abstract = {This is the first in a series of papers that investigate the properties of accretion flows in the Kerr metric through three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tori with a nearly Keplerian initial angular velocity profile. We study four models with increasing black hole spin, from a/M=0 to 0.998, for which the structural parameters of the initial tori are maintained nearly constant. The subsequent accretion flows arise self-consistently from stresses and turbulence created by the magnetorotational instability. We investigate the overall evolution and the late-time global structure in the resulting nonradiative accretion flows, including the magnetic fields within the disks, the properties of the flow in the plunging region, and the flux of conserved quantities into the black hole. Independent of black hole spin, the global structure is described in terms of five regions: the main disk body, the coronal envelope, the inner disk (consisting of an inner torus and plunging region), an evacuated axial funnel, and a biconical outflow confined to the corona-funnel boundary. We find evidence for lower accretion rates, stronger funnel-wall outflows, and increased stress in the near-hole region with increasing black hole spin.},

journal = {ApJ},
title = {Global Magnetohydrodynamical Simulations of Accretion Tori},
abstract = {Global time-dependent simulations provide a means to investigate time-dependent dynamic evolution in accretion disks. This paper seeks to extend previous local simulations by beginning a systematic effort to develop fully global three-dimensional simulations. The nonlinear development of the magnetorotational instability is investigated using a time-explicit finite difference code written in cylindrical coordinates. The equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics are solved with the assumption of an adiabatic equation of state. Both a Newtonian potential and a pseudo-Newtonian potential are used. Two simplifications are also explored: a cylindrical gravitational potential (the ``cylindrical disk'') and axisymmetry. The results from those simulations are compared with fully three-dimensional global simulations. The global simulations begin with equilibrium pressure-supported accretion tori. Two different initial field geometries are investigated: poloidal fields that are constant along initial equidensity surfaces and toroidal fields with a constant ratio of gas to magnetic pressure. In both cases the magnetorotational instability rapidly develops and the torus becomes turbulent. The resulting turbulence transports angular momentum, and the torus develops an angular momentum distribution that is near Keplerian. A comparison with axisymmetric simulations shows that in three dimensions the magnetorotational instability can act as a dynamo and regenerate poloidal field, thereby sustaining the turbulence. As previously observed in local simulations, the stress is dominated by the Maxwell component. The total stress in the interior of the disk is ~0.1-0.2 times the thermal pressure. At late time the disks are characterized by relatively thick configurations, with rapid time dependence and tightly wrapped, low-m spiral structures.},

title = {A Magnetohydrodynamic Nonradiative Accretion Flow in Three Dimensions},
abstract = {We present a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) three-dimensional simulation of a nonradiative accretion flow originating in a pressure-supported torus. The evolution is controlled by the magnetorotational instability, which produces turbulence. The flow forms a nearly Keplerian disk. The total pressure scale height in this disk is comparable to the vertical size of the initial torus. Gas pressure dominates near the equator; magnetic pressure is more important in the surrounding atmosphere. A magnetically dominated bound outflow is driven from the disk. The accretion rate through the disk exceeds the final rate into the hole, and a hot torus forms inside 10rg. Hot gas, pushed up against the centrifugal barrier and confined by magnetic pressure, is ejected in a narrow, unbound, conical outflow. The dynamics are controlled by magnetic turbulence, not thermal convection, and a hydrodynamic α-model is inadequate to describe the flow. The limitations of two-dimensional MHD simulations are also discussed.},

title = {Low-Frequency Oscillations in Global Simulations of Black Hole Accretion},
abstract = { We have identified the presence of large-scale, low-frequency dynamo cycles in a long-duration, global, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of black hole accretion. Such cycles had been seen previously in numerous local shearing box simulations of accretion, but this is to our knowledge the first time they have been identified in a global disk. The observed cycles manifest themselves as strong oscillations in the azimuthal magnetic field occupying a region that extends into a low-density corona several scale heights above the disk. The cycle frequencies are ten to twenty times lower than the local orbital frequency, making them potentially interesting sources of variability in real astrophysical systems. Furthermore, cycles manifest themselves at discrete frequencies that in many instances share power across broad radial ranges. We also explore possible connections between these simulated cycles and the observed low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) in galactic black hole binary systems. Specifically, we find that dynamo cycles have the appropriate frequencies and narrow-band profiles and that they are located in a spatial region associated with X-ray emission in real systems. Much theoretical work and more sophisticated simulations will be required to form a complete theory of dynamo-driven LFQPOs, but this work clearly illustrates that MHD dynamos can exhibit quasi-periodic behavior on timescales much longer than any timescale that would emerge from test particle considerations. },

abstract = { We investigate a massive ({\$}\varSigma \sim 10000 g cm^{-2}{\$} at 1 AU) protoplanetary disc model by means of 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations. The vertical structure of the disc is determined self-consistently by a balance between turbulent heating caused by the MRI and radiative cooling. Concerning the vertical structure, two different regions can be distinguished: A gas-pressure dominated, optically thick midplane region where most of the dissipation takes place, and a magnetically dominated, optically thin corona which is dominated by strong shocks. At the location of the photosphere, the turbulence is supersonic ({\$}M \sim 2{\$}), which is consistent with previous results obtained from the fitting of spectra of YSOs. It is known that the turbulent saturation level in simulations of MRI-induced turbulence does depend on numerical factors such as the numerical resolution and the box size. However, by performing a suite of runs at different resolutions (using up to 64x128x512 grid cells) and with varying box sizes (with up to 16 pressure scaleheights in the vertical direction), we find that both the saturation levels and the heating rates show a clear trend to converge once a sufficient resolution in the vertical direction has been achieved. },

title = {MRI channel flows in vertically stratified models of accretion discs},
abstract = {Simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in `unstratified' shearing boxes exhibit powerful coherent flows, whereby the fluid vertically splits into countermoving planar jets or `channels'. Channel flows correspond to certain axisymmetric linear MRI modes, and their preponderance follows from the remarkable fact that they are approximate non-linear solutions of the MHD equations in the limit of weak magnetic fields. We show in this paper, analytically and with one-dimensional numerical simulations, that this property is also shared by certain axisymmetric MRI modes in vertically stratified shearing boxes. These channel flows rapidly capture significant amounts of magnetic and kinetic energy, and thus are vulnerable to secondary shear instabilities. We examine these parasites in the vertically stratified context, and estimate the maximum amplitudes that channels attain before they are destroyed. These estimates suggest that a dominant channel flow will usually drive the disc's magnetic field to thermal strengths. The prominence of these flows and their destruction place enormous demands on simulations, but channels in their initial stages also offer a useful check on numerical codes. These benchmarks are especially valuable given the increasing interest in the saturation of the stratified MRI. Lastly, we speculate on the potential connection between `run-away' channel flows and outburst behaviour in protostellar and dwarf nova discs.},

title = {The Balbus-Hawley instability in weakly ionized discs},
abstract = {MHD in protostellar discs is modified by the Hall current when the ambipolar diffusion approximation breaks down. Here I examine the Balbus-Hawley (magnetorotational) instability of a weak, vertical magnetic field within a weakly ionized disc. Vertical stratification is neglected, and a linear analysis is undertaken for the case in which the wavevector of the perturbation is parallel to the magnetic field. The growth rate depends on whether the initial magnetic field is parallel or antiparallel to the angular momentum of the disc. The parallel case is less (more) unstable than the antiparallel case if the Hall current is dominated by negative (positive) species. The less-unstable orientation is stable for chi<~0.5, where chi is the ratio of a generalized neutral-ion collision frequency to the Keplerian frequency. The other orientation has a formal growth rate of the order of the Keplerian angular frequency even in the limit chi->0! In this limit the wavelength of the fastest-growing mode tends to infinity, so the minimum level of ionization for instability is determined by the requirement that a wavelength fit within a disc scaleheight. In the ambipolar diffusion case, this requires chi>v_Ac_s in the Hall case this imposes a potentially much weaker limit, chi>v A 2_c s 2.},

title = {Linear Analysis of the Hall Effect in Protostellar Disks},
abstract = {The effects of Hall electromotive forces (HEMFs) on the linear stability of protostellar disks are examined. Earlier work on this topic focused on axial field and perturbation wavenumber geometry. Here we treat the problem more generally. Both axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric cases are treated. Though seldom explicitly included in calculations, HEMFs appear to be important whenever Ohmic dissipation is. They allow for the appearance of electron whistler waves, and since these have right-hand polarization, a helicity factor is also introduced into the stability problem. This factor is the product of the components of the angular velocity and magnetic field along the perturbation wavenumber, and it is destabilizing when negative. An important finding of our more general calculation is that unless the field and angular velocity are exactly aligned, it is always possible to find destabilizing wavenumbers. HEMFs can destabilize any differential rotation law, even those with angular velocity increasing outward. Regardless of the sign of the angular velocity gradient, the maximum growth rate is always given in magnitude by the local Oort A value of the disk, as in the standard magnetorotational instability. The role of HEMFs may prove crucial to understanding how turbulence is maintained in the ``low state'' of eruptive disk systems.},

abstract = {By performing local three-dimensional MHD simulations of stratified accretion disks, we investigate disk winds driven by MHD turbulence. Initially weak vertical magnetic fields are effectively amplified by magnetorotational instability and winding due to differential rotation. Large-scale channel flows develop most effectively at 1.5-2 times the scale heights where the magnetic pressure is comparable to but slightly smaller than the gas pressure. The breakup of these channel flows drives structured disk winds by transporting the Poynting flux to the gas. These features are universally observed in the simulations of various initial fields. This disk wind process should play an essential role in the dynamical evaporation of protoplanetary disks. The breakup of channel flows also excites the momentum fluxes associated with Alfv{\'e}nic and (magneto-)sonic waves toward the midplane, which possibly contribute to the sedimentation of small dust grains in protoplanetary disks.},

We find that in the portions of the disk unstable to the ionization instability, the gas remains well coupled to the magnetic field even on the cold, neutral branch of the thermal limit cycle. This suggests that the ionization instability is not a significant source of large-amplitude time-dependent accretion in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We also argue that, for M>~10-2 Msolar yr-1, the gravitationally unstable and magnetorotationally unstable regions of the accretion disk overlap; for lower accretion rates they may not. Some low-luminosity AGN, e.g., NGC 4258, may thus be in a transient phase in which mass is building up in a nonaccreting gravitationally and magnetorotationally stable ``dead zone.'' We comment on possible implications of these findings.},

title = {Implementation of the Shearing Box Approximation in Athena},
abstract = {We describe the implementation of the shearing box approximation for the study of the dynamics of accretion disks in the Athena magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. Second-order Crank-Nicholson time differencing is used for the Coriolis and tidal gravity source terms that appear in the momentum equation for accuracy and stability. We show that this approach conserves energy for epicyclic oscillations in hydrodynamic flows to round-off error. In the energy equation, the tidal gravity source terms are differenced as the gradient of an effective potential in a way that guarantees that total energy (including the gravitational potential energy) is also conserved to round-off error. We introduce an orbital advection algorithm for MHD based on constrained transport to preserve the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. This algorithm removes the orbital velocity from the time step constraint, and makes the truncation error more uniform in radial position. Modifications to the shearing box boundary conditions applied at the radial boundaries are necessary to conserve the total vertical magnetic flux. In principle, similar corrections are also required to conserve mass, momentum, and energy; however in practice we find that the orbital advection method conserves these quantities to better than 0.03\% over hundreds of orbits. The algorithms have been applied to studies of the nonlinear regime of the MRI in very wide (up to 32 scale heights) horizontal domains.},

title = {Radiation-Dominated Disks are Thermally Stable},
abstract = {When the accretion rate is more than a small fraction of Eddington, the inner regions of accretion disks around black holes are expected to be radiation dominated. However, in the α-model, these regions are also expected to be thermally unstable. In this paper, we report two three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a vertically stratified shearing box in which the ratio of radiation to gas pressure is ~10, and yet no thermal runaway occurs over a timespan sime40 cooling times. Where the time-averaged dissipation rate is greater than the critical dissipation rate that creates hydrostatic equilibrium by diffusive radiation flux, the time-averaged radiation flux is held to the critical value, with the excess dissipated energy transported by radiative advection. Although the stress and total pressure are well correlated as predicted by the α-model, we show that stress fluctuations precede pressure fluctuations, contrary to the usual supposition that the pressure controls the saturation level of the magnetic energy. This fact explains the thermal stability. Using a simple toy model, we show that independently generated magnetic fluctuations can drive radiation pressure fluctuations, creating a correlation between the two while maintaining thermal stability.},

abstract = {We present the results of a series of radiation MHD simulations of a local patch of an accretion disk, with a fixed vertical gravity profile but with different surface mass densities and a broad range of radiation to gas pressure ratios. Each simulation achieves a thermal equilibrium that lasts for many cooling times. After averaging over times that are long compared to a cooling time, we find that the vertically integrated stress is approximately proportional to the vertically averaged total thermal (gas plus radiation) pressure. We map out---for the first time on the basis of explicit physics---the thermal equilibrium relation between stress and surface density: the stress decreases (increases) with increasing surface mass density when the simulation is radiation (gas) pressure dominated. The dependence of stress on surface mass density in the radiation pressure dominated regime suggests the possibility of a Lightman-Eardley inflow instability, but global simulations or shearing box simulations with much wider radial boxes will be necessary to confirm this and determine its nonlinear behavior.},

title = {Turbulent transport and its effect on the dead zone in protoplanetary discs},
abstract = {Context: Protostellar accretion discs have cool, dense midplanes where externally originating ionisation sources such as X-rays or cosmic rays are unable to penetrate. This suggests that for a wide range of radii, MHD turbulence can only be sustained in the surface layers where the ionisation fraction is sufficiently high. A dead zone is expected to exist near the midplane, such that active accretion only occurs near the upper and lower disc surfaces. Recent work, however, suggests that under suitable conditions the dead zone may be enlivened by turbulent transport of ions from the surface layers into the dense interior. Aims: In this paper we present a suite of simulations that examine where, and under which conditions, a dead zone can be enlivened by turbulent mixing. Methods: We use three-dimensional, multifluid shearing box MHD simulations, which include vertical stratification, ionisation chemistry, ohmic resistivity, and ionisation due to X-rays from the central protostar. We compare the results of the MHD simulations with a simple reaction-diffusion model. Results: The simulations show that in the absence of gas-phase heavy metals, such as magnesium, turbulent mixing has essentially no effect on the dead zone. The addition of a relatively low abundance of magnesium, however, increases the recombination time and allows turbulent mixing of ions to enliven the dead zone completely beyond a distance of 5 AU from the central star, for our particular disc model. Conclusions: During the late stages of protoplanetary disc evolution, when small grains have been depleted and the disc surface density has decreased below its high initial value, the structure of the dead zone may be significantly altered by the action of turbulent transport. This may have important consequences for ongoing planet formation in these discs.},

title = {Dust Transport in Protostellar Disks Through Turbulence and Settling},
abstract = {We apply ionization balance and magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) calculations to investigate whether magnetic activity moderated by recombination on dust grains can account for the mass accretion rates and the mid-infrared spectra and variability of protostellar disks. The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and include grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the resistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among solar-mass T Tauri stars is too large to result solely from variations in the grain size and stellar X-ray luminosity, but can plausibly be produced by varying these parameters together with the disk magnetic flux. The diverse shapes and strengths of the mid-infrared silicate bands can come from the coupling of grain settling to the distribution of the magnetorotational turbulence, through the following three effects. First, recombination on grains 1 μm or smaller yields a magnetically inactive dead zone extending more than two scale heights from the midplane, while turbulent motions in the magnetically active disk atmosphere overshoot the dead zone boundary by only about one scale height. Second, grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically in wave motions driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the rates found in laminar flow, so that the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk atmosphere will become dust-depleted unless resupplied from elsewhere. Third, with sufficient depletion, the dead zone is thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The last of these processes enables evolutionary signatures such as the degree of settling to sometimes decrease with age. The MHD results also show that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of small grains into the atmosphere. Consequently the photosphere height changes by up to one-third over timescales of a few orbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface varies by factors of 2 over times down to a tenth of an orbit. We suggest that the changing shadows cast by the dust clouds on the outer disk are a cause of the daily to monthly mid-infrared variability found in many young stars.},

title = {Dust settling in local simulations of turbulent protoplanetary disks},
abstract = {Aims.In this paper, we study the effect of MHD turbulence on the dynamics of dust particles in protoplanetary disks. We vary the size of the particles and relate the dust evolution to the turbulent velocity fluctuations. Methods: .We performed numerical simulations using two Eulerian MHD codes, both based on finite difference techniques: ZEUS-3D and NIRVANA. These were local shearing box simulations incorporating vertical stratification. Both ideal and non ideal MHD simulations with midplane dead zones were carried out. The codes were extended to incorporate different models for the dust as an additional fluid component. Good agreement between results obtained using the different approaches was obtained. Results: .The simulations show that a thin layer of very small dust particles is diffusively spread over the full vertical extent of the disk. We show that a simple description obtained using the diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient simply expressed in terms of the velocity correlations accurately matches the results. Dust settling starts to become apparent for particle sizes of the order of 1 to 10 centimeters for which the gas begins to decouple in a standard solar nebula model at 5.2 AU. However, for particles which are 10 centimeters in size, complete settling toward a very thin midplane layer is prevented by turbulent motions within the disk, even in the presence of a midplane dead zone of significant size. Conclusions: .These results indicate that, when present, MHD turbulence affects dust dynamics in protoplanetary disks. We find that the evolution and settling of the dust can be accurately modelled using an advection diffusion equation that incorporates vertical settling. The value of the diffusion coefficient can be calculated from the turbulent velocity field when that is known for a time of several local orbits.},

title = {MRI-driven turbulent transport: the role of dissipation, channel modes and their parasites},
abstract = {Context. In the recent years, MRI-driven turbulent transport has been found to depend in a significant way on fluid viscosity ν and resistivity η through the magnetic Prandtl number Pm = ν/η. In particular, the transport decreases with decreasing Pm; if persistent at very large Reynolds numbers, this trend may lead to question the role of MRI-turbulence in YSO disks, whose Prandtl number is usually very small. Aims: In this context, the principal objective of the present investigation is to characterize in a refined way the role of dissipation. Another objective is to characterize the effect of linear (channel modes) and quasi-linear (parasitic modes) physics in the behavior of the transport. Methods: These objectives are addressed with the help of a number of incompressible numerical simulations. The horizontal extent of the box size has been increased in order to capture all relevant (fastest growing) linear and secondary parasitic unstable modes. Results: The major results are the following: i- the increased accuracy in the computation of transport averages shows that the dependence of transport on physical dissipation exhibits two different regimes: for Pm ⪉ 1, the transport has a power-law dependence on the magnetic Reynolds number rather than on the Prandtl number; for Pm > 1, the data are consistent with a primary dependence on Pm for large enough (˜103) Reynolds numbers. ii- The transport-dissipation correlation is not clearly or simply related to variations of the linear modes growth rates. iii- The existence of the transport-dissipation correlation depends neither on the number of linear modes captured in the simulations, nor on the effect of the parasitic modes on the saturation of the linear modes growth. iv- The transport is usually not dominated by axisymmetric (channel) modes.},

title = {MHD simulations of the magnetorotational instability in a shearing box with zero net flux: the case Pm = 4},
abstract = {Aims: This letter investigates the transport properties of MHD turbulence induced by the magnetorotational instability at large Reynolds numbers Re when the magnetic Prandtl number Pm is larger than unity. Methods: Three MHD simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the unstratified shearing box with zero net flux are presented. These simulations are performed with the code Zeus and consider the evolution of the rate of angular momentum transport as Re is gradually increased from 3125 to 12 500 while simultaneously keeping Pm = 4. To ensure that the small scale features of the flow are well resolved, the resolution varies from 128 cells per disk scaleheight to 512 cells per scaleheight. The latter constitutes the highest resolution of an MRI turbulence simulation to date. Results: The rate of angular momentum transport, measured using the α parameter, depends only very weakly on the Reynolds number: α is found to be about 7 × 10-3 with variations around this mean value bounded by 15\% in all simulations. There is no systematic evolution with Re. For the best resolved model, the kinetic energy power spectrum tentatively displays a power-law range with an exponent -3/2, while the magnetic energy is found to shift to smaller and smaller scales as the magnetic Reynolds number increases. A couple of different diagnostics both suggest a well-defined injection length of a fraction of a scaleheight. Conclusions: The results presented in this letter are consistent with the MRI being able to transport angular momentum efficiently at large Reynolds numbers when Pm = 4 in unstratified zero net flux shearing boxes.},

title = {FARGO: A fast eulerian transport algorithm for differentially rotating disks},
abstract = {We present an efficient and simple modification of the standard transport algorithm used in explicit eulerian fixed polar grid codes, aimed at getting rid of the average azimuthal velocity when applying the Courant condition. This results in a much larger timestep than the usual procedure, and it is particularly well-suited to the description of a Keplerian disk where one is traditionally limited by the very demanding Courant condition on the fast orbital motion at the inner boundary. In this modified algorithm, the timestep is limited by the perturbed velocity and by the shear arising from the differential rotation. FARGO stands for ``Fast Advection in Rotating Gaseous Objects''. The speed-up resulting from the use of the FARGO algorithm is problem dependent. In the example presented here, which shows the evolution of a Jupiter sized protoplanet embedded in a minimum mass protoplanetary nebula, the FARGO algorithm is about an order of magnitude faster than a traditional transport scheme, with a much smaller numerical diffusivity.},

abstract = {We study numerically the evolution of rotating cloud cores, from the collapse of a magnetically supercritical core to the formation of a protostar and the development of a protostellar disk during the main accretion phase. We find that the disk quickly becomes unstable to the development of a spiral structure similar to that observed recently in AB Aurigae. A continuous infall of matter from the protostellar envelope makes the protostellar disk unstable, leading to spiral arms and the formation of dense protostellar/protoplanetary clumps within them. The growing strength of spiral arms and ensuing redistribution of mass and angular momentum creates a strong centrifugal disbalance in the disk and triggers bursts of mass accretion during which the dense protostellar/protoplanetary clumps fall onto the central protostar. These episodes of clump infall may manifest themselves as episodes of vigorous accretion (>=10-4 Msolar yr-1), as is observed in FU Orionis variables. Between these accretion bursts, the protostar is characterized by a low accretion rate (<10-6 Msolar yr-1). During the phase of episodic accretion, the mass of the protostellar disk remains less than the mass of the protostar.},

We determine the turbulent viscosity from non-rotating runs over a range of values of the shear parameter and use a simple analytical model in order to extract the non-diffusive contribution (\Lambda-effect) to the stress in runs where rotation is included. Our results suggest that the turbulent viscosity is of the order of the mixing length estimate and weakly affected by rotation. The \Lambda-effect is non-zero and a factor of 2-4 smaller than the turbulent viscosity in the slow rotation regime. We demonstrate that for Keplerian shear, the angular momentum transport can change sign and be outward when the rotation period is greater than the turnover time, i.e. when the Coriolis number is below unity. This result seems to be relatively independent of the value of the Rayleigh number. },

title = {On the relevance of subcritical hydrodynamic turbulence to accretion disk transport},
abstract = {Hydrodynamic unstratified Keplerian flows are known to be linearly stable at all Reynolds numbers, but may nevertheless become turbulent through nonlinear mechanisms. However, in the last ten years, conflicting points of view have appeared on this issue. We have revisited the problem through numerical simulations in the shearing sheet limit. It turns out that the effect of the Coriolis force in stabilizing the flow depends on whether the flow is cyclonic (cooperating shear and rotation vorticities) or anticyclonic (competing shear and rotation vorticities); Keplerian flows are anticyclonic. We have obtained the following results: i/ The Coriolis force does not quench turbulence in subcritical flows; however, turbulence is more efficient, and much more easily found, in cyclonic flows than in anticyclonic ones. ii/ The Reynolds number/rotation/resolution relation has been quantified in this problem. In particular we find that the resolution demand, when moving away from the marginal stability boundary, is much more severe for anticyclonic flows than for cyclonic ones. Presently available computer resources do not allow numerical codes to reach the Keplerian regime. iii/ The efficiency of turbulent transport is directly correlated to the Reynolds number of transition to turbulence Rg, in such a way that the Shakura-Sunyaev parameter α˜ 1/Rg. This correlation is nearly independent of the flow cyclonicity. The correlation is expected on the basis of generic physical arguments. iv/ Even the most optimistic extrapolations of our numerical data show that subcritical turbulent transport would be too inefficient in Keplerian flows by several orders of magnitude for astrophysical purposes. Vertical boundary conditions may play a role in this issue although no significant effect was found in our preliminary tests. v/ Our results suggest that the data obtained for Keplerian-like flows in a Taylor-Couette settings are largely affected by secondary flows, such as Ekman circulation.},

The relation is much tighter than the relation between Mbh and bulge luminosity, with a scatter no larger than expected on the basis of measurement error alone. Black hole masses recently estimated by Magorrian et al. lie systematically above the Mbh-σ relation defined by more accurate mass estimates, some by as much as 2 orders of magnitude. The tightness of the Mbh-σ relation implies a strong link between black hole formation and the properties of the stellar bulge.},

title = {The interaction of a giant planet with a disc with MHD turbulence - II. The interaction of the planet with the disc},
abstract = {We present a global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of a turbulent accretion disc interacting with a giant protoplanet of 5 Jupiter masses in a fixed circular orbit. The disc model had an aspect ratio H/r= 0.1, and in the absence of the protoplanet a typical value of the Shakura-Sunyaev stress parameter α= 5 × 10-3. As expected from previous work, the protoplanet was found to open and maintain a significant gap in the disc, with the interaction leading to inward migration of the protoplanet orbit on the expected time-scale. No evidence for a persistent net mass flow through the gap was found. However, this may be because an extensive inner cavity could not be formed for the model adopted. Spiral waves were launched by the protoplanet and, although these appeared to be diffused and dissipated through interaction with the turbulence, they produced an outward angular momentum flow which compensated for a reduced flux associated with the MHD turbulence near the planet, so maintaining the gap. When compared with laminar disc models, with the same estimated α in the absence of the planet, the gap was found to be deeper and wider, indicating that the turbulent disc behaved as if it in fact possessed a smaller α, even though analysis of the turbulent stress indicated that it was not significantly affected by the planet in the region away from the gap. This may arise for two reasons. First, unlike a Navier-Stokes viscosity with anomalous viscosity coefficient, the turbulence does not provide a source of constantly acting friction in the near vicinity of the planet that leads to steady mass flow into the gap region. Instead, the turbulence is characterized by large fluctuations in the radial velocity, and time averaging of these fluctuations over significant time-scales is required to recover the underlying mass flow through the disc. In the vicinity of the planet, the disc material experiences high amplitude periodic perturbations on time-scales that are short relative to the time-scale required for averaging. Consequently the disc response is likely to be significantly altered relative to that expected from a Navier-Stokes model. Secondly, the simulation indicates that an ordered magnetic connection between the inner and outer disc can occur enabling angular momentum to flow out across the gap, helping to maintain it independently of the protoplanet's tide. This type of effect may assist gap formation for smaller mass protoplanets which otherwise would not be able to maintain them. There is also some evidence that magnetic connection between the circumstellar disc and material that flows into the protoplanet's Hill sphere may lead to significant magnetic braking of the resulting circumplanetary disc, thereby modifying the expected gas accretion rate on to forming gas giant planets.},

title = {The interaction of giant planets with a disc with MHD turbulence - IV. Migration rates of embedded protoplanets},
abstract = {We present the results of global cylindrical disc simulations and local shearing box simulations of protoplanets interacting with a disc undergoing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. The specific emphasis of this paper is to examine and quantify the magnitude of the torque exerted by the disc on the embedded protoplanets as a function of the protoplanet mass, and thus to make a first study of the induced orbital migration of protoplanets resulting from their interaction with magnetic, turbulent discs. This issue is of crucial importance in understanding the formation of gas giant planets through the so-called core instability model, and the subsequent orbital evolution post-formation prior to the dispersal of the protostellar disc. Current estimates of the migration time of protoplanetary cores in the 3-30 Earth mass range in standard disc models are τmig~= 104-105 yr, which is much shorter than the estimated gas accretion time-scale of Jupiter-type planets. The global simulations were carried out for a disc with constant aspect ratio H/r= 0.07 and protoplanet masses of Mp= 3, 10, 30 Earth masses, and 3 Jupiter masses. The local shearing box simulations were carried out for values of the dimensionless parameter (Mp/M*)/(H/R)3= 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 2.0, with M*, R and H being the central mass, the orbital radius and the local disc semithickness, respectively. These allow both embedded and gap-forming protoplanets for which the disc response is non-linear to be investigated. In all cases the instantaneous net torque experienced by a protoplanet showed strong fluctuations on an orbital time-scale, and in the low-mass embedded cases oscillated between negative and positive values. Consequently, in contrast to the laminar disc type I migration scenario, orbital migration would occur as a random walk. Running time averages for embedded protoplanets over typical run times of 20-25 orbital periods indicated that the averaged torques from the inner and outer disc took on values characteristic of type I migration. However, large fluctuations occurring on longer than orbital time-scales remained, preventing convergence of the average torque to well-defined values or even to a well-defined sign for these lower mass cases. Fluctuations became relatively smaller for larger masses indicating better convergence properties, to the extent that in the 30-M⊕ simulation consistently inward, albeit noisy, migration was indicated. Both the global and local simulations showed this trend with increasing protoplanet mass, which is due to its perturbation on the disc increasing to become comparable to and then dominate the turbulence in its neighbourhood. The turbulence then becomes unable to produce very large long-term fluctuations in the torques acting on the protoplanet. Eventually gap formation occurs and there is a transition to the usual type II migration at a rate determined by the angular momentum transport in the distant parts of the disc. The existence of significant fluctuations occurring in the turbulent discs on long time-scales is an important unexplored issue for the lower mass embedded protoplanets, which are unable to modify the turbulence in their neighbourhood, and which have been studied here. If significant fluctuations occur on the longest disc evolutionary time-scales, convergence of torque running averages for practical purposes will not occur and the migration behaviour of low-mass protoplanets considered as an ensemble will be very different from predictions of type I migration theory for laminar discs. The fact that noise levels were relatively smaller in the local simulations may indicate the presence of long-term global fluctuations, but the issue remains an important one for future investigation.},

title = {The interaction of a giant planet with a disc with MHD turbulence - I. The initial turbulent disc models},
abstract = {This is the first of a series of papers aimed at developing and interpreting simulations of protoplanets interacting with turbulent accretion discs. In this first paper we study the turbulent disc models prior to the introduction of a perturbing protoplanet. We study cylindrical disc models in which a central domain is in Keplerian rotation and unstable to the magnetorotational instability. Models of varying disc size and aspect ratio H/r are considered with magnetic fields having zero net flux. We relate the properties of the turbulent models to classical viscous disc theory. All models were found to attain a turbulent state in their Keplerian domains with volume averaged stress parameter α~ 5 × 10-3. At any particular time the vertically and azimuthally averaged value exhibited large fluctuations in radius. However, an additional time average over periods exceeding three orbital periods at the outer boundary of the Keplerian domain resulted in a more smoothly varying quantity with radial variations within a factor of 2 or so. The vertically and azimuthally averaged radial velocity showed much larger spatial and temporal fluctuations, requiring additional time averaging for at least seven to eight orbital periods at the outer boundary of the Keplerian domain to limit them. Comparison with the value derived from the averaged stress using viscous disc theory yielded schematic agreement for feasible averaging times but with some indication that the effects of residual fluctuations remained. The behaviour described above must be borne in mind when considering laminar disc simulations with anomalous Navier-Stokes viscosity. This is because the operation of a viscosity, as in classical viscous disc theory with anomalous viscosity coefficient, cannot apply to a turbulent disc undergoing rapid changes due to external perturbation. The classical theory can only be used to describe the time averaged behaviour of the parts of the disc that are in a statistically steady condition long enough for appropriate averaging to be carried out.},

title = {The interaction of giant planets with a disc with MHD turbulence - III. Flow morphology and conditions for gap formation in local and global simulations},
abstract = {We present the results of both global cylindrical disc simulations and local shearing box simulations of protoplanets interacting with a disc undergoing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence with zero net flux magnetic fields. We investigate the nature of the disc response and conditions for gap formation. This issue is an important one for determining the type and nature of the migration of the protoplanet, with the presence of a deep gap being believed to enable slower migration. For both types of simulation we find a common pattern of behaviour for which the main parameter determining the nature of the response is MpR3/(M*H3), with Mp, M*, R and H being the protoplanet mass, the central mass, the orbital radius and the local disc semi-thickness respectively. We find that as MpR3/(M*H3) is increased to ~ 0.1 the presence of the protoplanet is first indicated by the appearance of the well-known trailing wake which, although it may appear to be erratic on account of the turbulence, appears to be well-defined. Once MpR3/(M*H3) exceeds a number around unity, a gap starts to develop inside which the magnetic energy density tends to be concentrated in the high-density wakes. This condition for gap formation can be understood from simple dimensional considerations of the conditions for non-linearity and the balance of angular momentum transport due to Maxwell and Reynolds' stresses with that due to tidal torques applied to the parameters of our simulations. An important result is that the basic flow morphology in the vicinity of the protoplanet is very similar in both the local and global simulations. This indicates that, regardless of potentially unwanted effects arising from the periodic boundary conditions, local shearing box simulations, which are computationally less demanding, capture much of the physics of disc-planet interactions. Thus they may provide a useful tool for studying the local interaction between forming protoplanets and turbulent, protostellar discs.},

title = {Trapping solids at the inner edge of the dead zone: 3-D global MHD simulations},
abstract = {Context. The poorly-ionized interior of the protoplanetary disk or ``dead zone'' is the location where dust coagulation processes may be most efficient. However even here, planetesimal formation may be limited by the loss of solid material through radial drift, and by collisional fragmentation of the particles. Both depend on the turbulent properties of the gas. Aims: Our aim here is to investigate the possibility that solid particles are trapped at local pressure maxima in the dynamically evolving disk. We perform the first 3-D global non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) calculations of a section of the disk treating the turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). Methods: We use the ZeusMP code with a fixed Ohmic resistivity distribution. The domain contains an inner MRI-active region near the young star and an outer midplane dead zone, with the transition between the two modeled by a sharp increase in the magnetic diffusivity. Results: The azimuthal magnetic fields generated in the active zone oscillate over time, changing sign about every 150 years. We thus observe the radial structure of the ``butterfly pattern'' seen previously in local shearing-box simulations. The mean magnetic field diffuses from the active zone into the dead zone, where the Reynolds stress nevertheless dominates, giving a residual α between 10-4 and 10-3. The greater total accretion stress in the active zone leads to a net reduction in the surface density, so that after 800 years an approximate steady state is reached in which a local radial maximum in the midplane pressure lies near the transition radius. We also observe the formation of density ridges within the active zone. Conclusions: The dead zone in our models possesses a mean magnetic field, significant Reynolds stresses and a steady local pressure maximum at the inner edge, where the outward migration of planetary embryos and the efficient trapping of solid material are possible.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The mechanism of angular momentum transport in accretion discs has long been debated. Although the magnetorotational instability appears to be a promising process, poorly ionized regions of accretion discs may not undergo this instability. In this Letter, we revisit the possibility of transporting angular momentum by turbulent thermal convection. Using high-resolution spectral methods, we show that strongly turbulent convection can drive outward angular momentum transport at a rate that is, under certain conditions, compatible with observations of discs. We find, however, that the angular momentum transport is always much weaker than the vertical heat transport. These results indicate that convection might be another way to explain global disc evolution, provided that a sufficiently unstable vertical temperature profile can be maintained.},

We find that both Kelvin-Helmholtz and tearing mode instabilities can operate to saturate the field amplification driven by the magnetorotational instability in the dissipative regimes accessible to current numerical simulations. The value of the stresses at saturation depends critically on whether the fastest growing magnetorotational and parasitic modes can fit within the domain under consideration and whether non-axisymmetric parasitic modes are allowed to be excited. Our results suggest that, even if viscous and resistive scales are well resolved in simulations, saturation may not be well determined unless the numerical domain is large enough to allow the evolution of the fastest growing magnetorotational and parasitic modes. },

abstract = {A new code for astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is described. The code has been designed to be easily extensible for use with static and adaptive mesh refinement. It combines higher order Godunov methods with the constrained transport (CT) technique to enforce the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. Discretization is based on cell-centered volume averages for mass, momentum, and energy, and face-centered area averages for the magnetic field. Novel features of the algorithm include (1) a consistent framework for computing the time- and edge-averaged electric fields used by CT to evolve the magnetic field from the time- and area-averaged Godunov fluxes, (2) the extension to MHD of spatial reconstruction schemes that involve a dimensionally split time advance, and (3) the extension to MHD of two different dimensionally unsplit integration methods. Implementation of the algorithm in both C and FORTRAN95 is detailed, including strategies for parallelization using domain decomposition. Results from a test suite which includes problems in one-, two-, and three-dimensions for both hydrodynamics and MHD are given, not only to demonstrate the fidelity of the algorithms, but also to enable comparisons to other methods.

title = {Saturn Forms by Core Accretion in 3.4 Myr},
abstract = { We present two new in situ core accretion simulations of Saturn with planet formation timescales of 3.37 Myr (model S0) and 3.48 Myr (model S1), consistent with observed protostellar disk lifetimes. In model S0, we assume rapid grain settling reduces opacity due to grains from full interstellar values (Podolak 2003). In model S1, we do not invoke grain settling, instead assigning full interstellar opacities to grains in the envelope. Surprisingly, the two models produce nearly identical formation timescales and core/atmosphere mass ratios. We therefore observe a new manifestation of core accretion theory: at large heliocentric distances, the solid core growth rate (limited by Keplerian orbital velocity) controls the planet formation timescale. We argue that this paradigm should apply to Uranus and Neptune as well. },

title = {The role of magnetic fields in star formation},
abstract = { Star formation is thought to be triggered by the gravitational collapse of the dense cores of molecular clouds. Angular momentum conservation during the collapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which eventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a central mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum transport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through this disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of their mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular momentum are not well understood. The most promising are turbulence viscosity driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and outflows accelerated centrifugally from the surfaces of the disc. Both processes are powered by the action of magnetic fields and are, in turn, likely to strongly affect the structure, dynamics, evolutionary path and planet-forming capabilities of their host discs. The weak ionization of protostellar discs, however, may prevent the magnetic field from effectively coupling to the gas and drive these processes. Here I examine the viability and properties of these magnetically driven processes in protostellar discs. The results indicate that, despite the weak ionization, the field is able to couple to the gas and shear for fluid conditions thought to be satisfied over a wide range of radii in these discs. },

title = {Impact of dimensionless numbers on the efficiency of magnetorotational instability induced turbulent transport},
abstract = {The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is presently the most promising source of turbulent transport in accretion discs. However, some important issues still need to be addressed to quantify the role of MRI in discs; in particular no systematic investigation of the role of the physical dimensionless parameters of the problem on the dimensionless transport has been undertaken yet. For completeness, we first generalize existing results on the marginal stability limit in the presence of both viscous and resistive dissipation, exhibit simple scalings for all relevant limits, and give them a physical interpretation. We then re-examine the question of transport efficiency through numerical simulations in the simplest setting of a local, unstratified shearing box, with the help of a pseudo-spectral incompressible 3D code; viscosity and resistivity are explicitly accounted for. We focus on the effect of the dimensionless magnetic field strength, the Reynolds number and the magnetic Prandtl number. First, we complete existing investigations on the field strength dependence by showing that the transport in high magnetic pressure discs close to marginal stability is highly time dependent and surprisingly efficient. Secondly, we bring to light a significant dependence of the global transport on the magnetic Prandtl number, with α ~ Pmδ for the explored range: 0.12 < Pm < 8 and 200 < Re < 6400 (δ being in the range 0.25-0.5). We show that the dimensionless transport is not correlated to the dimensionless linear growth rate, contrary to a largely held expectation. For large enough Reynolds numbers, one would expect that the reported Prandtl number scaling of the transport should saturate, but such a saturation is out of reach of the present generation of supercomputers. Understanding this saturation process is nevertheless quite critical to accretion disc transport theory, as the magnetic Prandtl number Pm is expected to vary by many orders of magnitude between the various classes of discs, from Pm << 1 in young stellar object discs to Pm >~ or >>1 in active galactic nucleus discs. More generally, these results stress the need to control dissipation processes in astrophysical simulations.},

We adopt the most compact form of CT, which requires the field be represented by area-averages at cell faces. We demonstrate that the fluxes of the area-averaged field used by CT can be made consistent with the fluxes of the volume-averaged field returned by a Riemann solver if they obey certain simple relationships. We use these relationships to derive new algorithms for constructing the CT fluxes at grid cell corners which reduce exactly to the equivalent one-dimensional solver for plane-parallel, grid-aligned flow. We show that the PPM reconstruction algorithm must include multidimensional terms for MHD, and we describe a number of important extensions that must be made to CTU in order for it to be used for MHD with CT. We present the results of a variety of test problems to demonstrate the method is accurate and robust.},

title = {Piecewise Parabolic Method on a Local Stencil for Magnetized Supersonic  Turbulence Simulation},
abstract = { Stable, accurate, divergence-free simulation of magnetized supersonic turbulence is a severe test of numerical MHD schemes and has been surprisingly difficult to achieve due to the range of flow conditions present. Here we present a new, higher order-accurate, low dissipation numerical method which requires no additional dissipation or local "fixes" for stable execution. We describe PPML, a local stencil variant of the popular PPM algorithm for solving the equations of compressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics. The principal difference between PPML and PPM is that cell interface states are evolved rather that reconstructed at every timestep, resulting in a compact stencil. Interface states are evolved using Riemann invariants containing all transverse derivative information. The conservation laws are updated in an unsplit fashion, making the scheme fully multidimensional. Divergence-free evolution of the magnetic field is maintained using the higher order-accurate constrained transport technique of Gardiner and Stone. The accuracy and stability of the scheme is documented against a bank of standard test problems drawn from the literature. The method is applied to numerical simulation of supersonic MHD turbulence, which is important for many problems in astrophysics, including star formation in dark molecular clouds. PPML accurately reproduces in three-dimensions a transition to turbulence in highly compressible isothermal gas in a molecular cloud model. The low dissipation and wide spectral bandwidth of this method make it an ideal candidate for direct turbulence simulations. },

title = {The Magnetohydrodynamic Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability: A Two-dimensional Numerical Study},
abstract = {We have carried out two-dimensional simulations of the nonlinear evolution of unstable sheared magnetohydrodynamic flows. These calculations extend the earlier work of Miura (1984) and consider periodic sections of flows containing aligned magnetic fields. Two equal density, compressible fluids are separated by a shear layer with a hyperbolic tangent velocity profile. We considered two cases: a strong magnetic field (Alfv{\'e}n Mach number, MA = 2.5) and a weak field (MA = 5). Each flow rapidly evolves until it reaches a nearly steady condition, which is fundamentally different from the analogous gas- dynamic state. Both MHD flows relax to a stable, laminar flow on timescales less than or of the order of 15 linear growth times, measured from saturation of the instability. That timescale is several orders of magnitude less than the nominal dissipation time for these simulated flows, so this condition represents an quasi-steady relaxed state analogous to the long-lived single vortex, known as "Kelvin's Cat's Eye," formed in two-dimensional nearly ideal gasdynamic simulations of a vortex sheet. The strong magnetic field case reaches saturation as magnetic tension in the displaced flow boundary becomes sufficient to stabilize it. That flow then relaxes in a straightforward way to the steady, laminar flow condition. The weak magnetic field case, on the other hand, begins development of the vortex expected for gasdynamics, but that vortex is destroyed by magnetic stresses that locally become strong. Magnetic topologies lead to reconnection and dynamical alignment between magnetic and velocity fields. Together these processes produce a sequence of intermittent vortices and subsequent relaxation to a nearly laminar flow condition in which the magnetic cross helicity is nearly maximized. Remaining irregularities show several interesting properties. A pair of magnetic flux tubes are formed that straddle the boundary between the oppositely moving fluids. Velocity and magnetic fluctuations within those features are closely aligned, representing Alfv{\'e}n waves propagating locally downstream. The flux tubes surround a low-density channel of hot gas that contains most of the excess entropy generated through the relaxation process.},

Finite-difference computations of the equations of compressible MHD are carried out on an axisymmetric shearing sheet system with periodic boundary conditions designed to approximate a local region within an accretion disk. Initial field configurations that include some net vertical component evolve into a nonlinear, exponentially growing solution with large poloidal velocities and magnetic fields with energies comparable to the thermal energy density. The stability of a purely azimuthal field configuration is examined, and it is found that nonaxisymmetric instability is present, but with a growth time measured in tens of orbital periods. In general, the most rapid growth occurs for very small radial and azimuthal wavenumbers, leading to coherent magnetic field structure in planes parallel to the disk. It is suggested that this instability is a key ingredient for the generation of magnetic fields in disks.},

title = {Magnetohydrodynamics of Protostellar Disks},
abstract = { The magnetohydrodynamical behavior (MHD) of accretion disks is reviewed. A detailed presentation of the fundamental MHD equations appropriate for protostellar disks is given. The combination of a weak (subthermal) magnetic field and Keplerian rotation is unstable to the magnetorotational instability (MRI), if the degree of ionization in the disk is sufficiently high. The MRI produces enhanced angular momentum and leads to a breakdown of laminar flow into turbulence. If the turbulent energy is dissipated locally, standard "{\$}\alpha{\$}" modeling should give a reasonable estimate for the disk structure. Because away from the central star the ionization fraction of protostellar disks is small, they are generally not in the regime of near perfect conductivity. Nonideal MHD effects are important. Of these, Ohmic dissipation and Hall electromotive forces are the most important. The presence of dust is also critical, as small interstellar scale grains absorb free charges that are needed for good magnetic coupling. On scales of AU's there may be a region near the disk midplane that is magnetically decoupled, a so-called {\em dead zone.} But the growth and settling of the grains as time evolves reduces their efficiency to absorb charge. With ionization provided by coronal X-rays from the central star (and possibly also cosmic rays), protostellar disks may be sufficiently magnetized throughout most of their lives to be MRI active, especially away from the disk midplane. },

title = {Spectral Methods for Time-Dependent Studies of Accretion Flows. III. Three-Dimensional, Self-Gravitating, Magnetohydrodynamic Disks},
abstract = {Accretion disks are three-dimensional, turbulent, often self-gravitating, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows, which can be modeled with numerical simulations. In this paper, we present a new algorithm that is based on a spectral decomposition method to simulate such flows. Because of the high order of the method, we can solve the induction equation in terms of the magnetic vector potential and, therefore, ensure trivially that the magnetic fields in the numerical solution are divergence free. The spectral method also suffers minimally from numerical dissipation and allows for an easy implementation of models for subgrid physics. Both properties make our method ideal for studying MHD turbulent flows such as those found in accretion disks around compact objects. We verify our algorithm with a series of standard tests and use it to show the development of MHD turbulence in a simulation of an accretion disk. Finally, we study the evolution and saturation of the power spectrum of MHD turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability.},

title = {Addendum: ``Orbital Advection by Interpolation: A Fast and Accurate Numerical Scheme for Super-Fast MHD Flows'' (ApJS, 177, 373 [2008])},
abstract = {The descriptions of some of the numerical tests in our original paper are incomplete, making reproduction of the results difficult. We provide the missing details here. The relevant tests are described in {\S} 4 of the original paper (Figs. 8-11). We use the analytical solutions outlined by B. M. Johnson (ApJ, 660, 1375 [2007]) as the initial conditions for the linear tests in B. M. Johnson et al. (ApJS, 177, 373, [2008]). The incompressive solution is given by the real parts of expressions (80)-(82) of that paper. For imaginary ω and ω˜ and a Keplerian rotation profile, these areδv=δv˜cos(k˙x+π/4) (1)andδvA=δv˜Acos(k˙x-π/4), (2)withδv˜={\&}Ascr;i(k2x-k2,kxky-(k2)/2α,kxkz+(k2ky)/(2αkz)) (3)andδv˜A=-(vA˙k)/|ω|{\&}Ascr;i(k2x-k2,kxky+2αk2z,kxkz-2αkykz), (4)where{\&}Ascr;i=εcsH|ω˜|/Ωsqrt(|ω|Ω/(2|ω˜2|k2+Ω2k2z)) (5)andα=Ω|ω|/(|ω˜2|). (6)Here, H=cs/Ω is the disk scale height, k is the initial wavenumber of the perturbation, and ɛ is an arbitrary perturbation amplitude; other symbols have their usual meanings. These solutions have been normalized to the correct dimensional units.2 The density perturbation is given byδρ/(ρ0)=[-(vA)/(cs)˙(δv˜A)/(cs)+2Ω/(csk)((kx)/k{\^y}+(ky)/2kx̂)˙(δv˜)/(cs)cos(k˙x-π/4). (7) The unstable branch of the incompressive dispersion relation is|ω˜2|=((kzΩ)/k)2[sqrt(1+((4kvA˙k)/(kzΩ))2)-1 (8)and|ω|=sqrt(|ω˜2|-(vA˙k)2). (9)For our choice of initial parameters, vA=sqrt(15/16)(Ω/kz){\^z} and Hk=2π(-2/10,1/10,1), these become|ω˜2|=Ω25/21(sqrt(67)-2)~=1.47Ω2 (10)and|ω|=Ωsqrt(5/21)(sqrt(67)-95/16)1/2~=0.732Ω. (11)The perturbations in this limit are given byδv˜=-({\&}Ascr;i)/(H2)(2π)2(101/100,1/50+21/40α,1/5-21/400α) (12)andδv˜A=sqrt(15/16)Ω/|ω|({\&}Ascr;i)/(H2)(2π)2(101/100,1/50-2α,1/5+α/5), (13)with({\&}Ascr;i)/(H2)=εcs|ω|/2πΩ(2/αsqrt(67))1/2 (14)andα=(sqrt(21)(sqrt(67)-95/16)1/2)/(sqrt(5)(sqrt(67)-2))~=0.497. (15)Dividing through by an overall factor of H2(k2x-k2)=-(2π)2(101/100) gives the initial conditions quoted in our original paper (with ε=10-6 and cs=Ω=ρ0=1). We make comparisons based upon the amplitude of the solution, i.e. δv˜ and δv˜A rather than δv and δvA. In Figures 8-10 of our original paper, then, the quantity that is being plotted is δv˜2+δv˜2A. To extract these quantities from the code, we perform spatial sine and cosine Fourier transforms in shearing coordinates on each of the velocity and magnetic field components, and sum the squares of the transforms. As a concrete example, the cosine transform of the radial velocity component is given by(δ{\~v}x[tn])numerical=2/(NxNyNz)Σi=1NxΣj=1NyΣk=1Nzvxnijkcos(k[tn˙xijk), (16)where k(t)=k(0)+qΩkytx̂. Since the solution as expressed above breaks down as ω transitions from imaginary to real, we calculate the analytical amplitudes for the incompressive tests based upon an integration of the full set of linear equations.3 The compressive solution is given by the real part of expressions (83)-(85) of B. M. Johnson (ApJ, 660, 1375 [2007]):(δv,δvA,δρ)=(δv˜,δv˜A,δρ˜)cos(k˙x), (17)withδv˜=ω/ω˜{\&}Ascr;c((ω2)/(k2)k-vA˙kvA), (18)δv˜A=(ω2)/ω˜{\&}Ascr;c(vA-(vA˙k)/(k2)k), (19)andδρ˜/(ρ0)=ω˜{\&}Ascr;c, (20)where{\&}Ascr;c=εHksqrt(ωΩ/(ω4-(vA˙k)2c2sk2)). (21) Our choice of initial parameters for this test, vA=cs(0.1,0.2,0.0) and Hk=4π(-2,1,1), gives vA˙k=0, so that the nonzero solution to the compressive dispersion relation isω2=(c2s+v2A)k2. (22)The perturbations in this limit are given by(δv˜,δv˜A,δρ˜/ρ0)=ε(vAsqrt(1+β)k̂,vA,1)(Hksqrt(β/1+β))1/2, (23)where β=c2s/v2A. For our initial conditions (β=20), this is(δv˜,δv˜A,δρ˜/ρ0)=ε((cs)/2sqrt(7/10)(Hk)/4π,vA,1)(8πsqrt(10/7))1/2, (24)which matches the numbers given in our original paper (with ε=10-6 and cs=Ω=ρ0=1). Figure 11 of our original paper shows the evolution of the azimuthal component of δv˜A. The numerical results are(δ{\~v}Ay[tn])numerical=2/(NxNyNz)Σi=1NxΣj=1NyΣk=1Nz((bynijk)/(sqrt(4πρ0))-vAy[tn])cos(k[tn]˙xijk). (25)and the analytical results are calculated within the code using the time dependent version of expression (24), i.e.(δ{\~v}Ay[tn])analytical=vAy[tn](8πsqrt(10/7))1/2cos(Σn'=0nω[tn']dtn'), (26)with dt0=0. As a final practical consideration, implementing the solutions as described above can introduce divergence into the initial conditions. To avoid this, we calculate the vector potential in the Coulomb gauge (k˙δA=0) for the above solutions and numerically calculate its curl to obtain the initial magnetic field perturbation. The perturbed vector potential is(δA)/(sqrt(4πρ0))=-(vA˙k)/|ω|{\&}Ascr;ikz(2α[(k2x)/(k2)-1,2α(kxky)/(k2)-1,2α(kxkz)/(k2)+(ky)/(kz))cos(k˙x+π/4) (27)for the incompressive solution and(δA)/(sqrt(4πρ0))=(ω2vAXk)/(ω˜k2){\&}Ascr;csin(k˙x) (28)for the compressive solution. For our initial conditions, these reduce to(δA)/(sqrt(4πρ0))=ε(csH)/14(1/30αsqrt(67))1/2(202α,4α+105,40α-21/2)cos(k˙x+π/4) (29)for the incompressive solution (with α given by expression [15]), and(δA)/(sqrt(4πρ0))=ε(csH)/60(1/πsqrt(5/14))1/2(2,-1,5)sin(k˙x) (30)for the compressive solution.

title = {Light Curves from an MHD Simulation of a Black Hole Accretion Disk},
abstract = {We use a relativistic ray-tracing code to calculate the light curves observed from a global, general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulation of an accretion flow onto a Schwarzschild black hole. We apply three basic emission models to sample different properties of the time-dependent accretion disk. With one of these models, which assumes thermal blackbody emission and free-free absorption, we can predict qualitative features of the high-frequency power spectrum from stellar-mass black holes in the ``thermal dominant'' state. The simulated power spectrum is characterized by a power law of index Γ~3 and total rms fractional variance of <~2\% above 10 Hz. For each emission model, we find that the variability amplitude should increase with increasing inclination angle. On the basis of a newly developed formalism for quantifying the significance of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in simulation data, we find that these simulations are able to identify any such features with (rms/mean) amplitudes >~1\% near the orbital frequency at the innermost stable orbit. Initial results indicate the existence of transient QPO peaks with frequency ratios of nearly 2:3 at a 99.9\% confidence limit, but they are not generic features, because at any given time they are seen only from certain observer directions. In addition, we present detailed analysis of the azimuthal structure of the accretion disk and the evolution of density perturbations in the inner disk. These ``hot-spot'' structures appear to be roughly self-similar over a range of disk radii, with a single characteristic size δφ=25deg and δr/r=0.3, and typical lifetimes Tl~0.3Torb.},

title = {Viscous and Resistive Effects on the Magnetorotational Instability with a Net Toroidal Field},
abstract = {Resistivity and viscosity have a significant role in establishing the energy levels in turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in local astrophysical disk models. This study uses the Athena code to characterize the effects of a constant shear viscosity ν and Ohmic resistivity η in unstratified shearing box simulations with a net toroidal magnetic flux. A previous study of shearing boxes with zero net magnetic field performed with the ZEUS code found that turbulence dies out for values of the magnetic Prandtl number, P m = ν/η, below P m ~ 1; for P m gsim 1, time- and volume-averaged stress levels increase with P m. We repeat these experiments with Athena and obtain consistent results. Next, the influence of viscosity and resistivity on the toroidal field MRI is investigated both for linear growth and for fully developed turbulence. In the linear regime, a sufficiently large ν or η can prevent MRI growth; P m itself has little direct influence on growth from linear perturbations. By applying a range of values for ν and η to an initial state consisting of fully developed turbulence in the presence of a background toroidal field, we investigate their effects in the fully nonlinear system. Here, increased viscosity enhances the turbulence, and the turbulence decays only if the resistivity is above a critical value; turbulence can be sustained even when P m < 1, in contrast to the zero net field model. While we find preliminary evidence that the stress converges to a small range of values when ν and η become small enough, the influence of dissipation terms on MRI-driven turbulence for relatively large η and ν is significant, independent of field geometry.},

abstract = { Observations of protostellar disks indicate the presence of the magnetic field of thermal (or superthermal) strength. In such a strong magnetic field, many MHD instabilities responsible for turbulent transport of the angular momentum are suppressed. We consider the shear-driven instability that can occur in protostellar disks even if the field is superthermal. This instability is caused by the combined influence of shear and compressibility in a magnetized gas and can be an efficient mechanism to generate turbulence in disks. The typical growth time is of the order of several rotation periods. },

title = {MHD simulations of the magnetorotational instability in a shearing box with zero net flux. II. The effect of transport coefficients},
abstract = {Aims.We study the influence of the choice of transport coefficients (viscosity and resistivity) on MHD turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in accretion disks. Methods: We follow the methodology described in Paper I: we adopt an unstratified shearing box model and focus on the case where the net vertical magnetic flux threading the box vanishes. For the most part we use the operator split code ZEUS, including explicit transport coefficients in the calculations. However, we also compare our results with those obtained using other algorithms (NIRVANA, the PENCIL code and a spectral code) to demonstrate both the convergence of our results and their independence of the numerical scheme. Results: We find that small scale dissipation affects the saturated state of MHD turbulence. In agreement with recent similar numerical simulations done in the presence of a net vertical magnetic flux, we find that turbulent activity (measured by the rate of angular momentum transport) is an increasing function of the magnetic Prandtl number Pm for all values of the Reynolds number Re that we investigated. We also found that turbulence disappears when the Prandtl number falls below a critical value Pmc that is apparently a decreasing function of Re. For the limited region of parameter space that can be probed with current computational resources, we always obtained Pmc>1. Conclusions: We conclude that the magnitudes of the transport coefficients are important in determining the properties of MHD turbulence in numerical simulations in the shearing box with zero net flux, at least for Reynolds numbers and magnetic Prandtl numbers that are such that transport is not dominated by numerical effects and thus can be probed using current computational resources.},

abstract = { Local simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in accretion disks can exhibit recurrent coherent structures called channel flows. The formation and destruction of these structures may play a role in the development and saturation of MRI-induced turbulence, and consequently help us understand the time-dependent accretion behaviour of certain astrophysical objects. Previous investigations have revealed that channel solutions are attacked by various parasitic modes, foremost of which is an analogue of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We revisit these instabilities and show how they relate to the classical instabilities of plasma physics, the kink and pinch modes. However, we argue that in most cases channels emerge from developed turbulence and are eventually destroyed by turbulent mixing, not by the parasites. The exceptions are the clean isolated channels which appear in systems near criticality or which emerge from low amplitude initial conditions. These structures inevitably achieve large amplitudes and are only then destroyed, giving rise to eruptive behaviour. },

title = {Angular Momentum Transport in Accretion Disks: Scaling Laws in MRI-driven Turbulence},
abstract = {We present a scaling law that predicts the values of the stresses obtained in numerical simulations of saturated MRI-driven turbulence in nonstratified shearing boxes. It relates the turbulent stresses to the strength of the vertical magnetic field, the sound speed, the vertical size of the box, and the numerical resolution and predicts accurately the results of 35 numerical simulations performed for a wide variety of physical conditions. We use our result to show that the saturated stresses in simulations with zero net magnetic flux depend linearly on the numerical resolution and would become negligible if the resolution were set equal to the natural dissipation scale in astrophysical disks. We conclude that in order for MRI-driven turbulent angular momentum transport to be able to account for the large value of the effective alpha viscosity inferred observationally, the disk must be threaded by a significant vertical magnetic field and the turbulent magnetic energy must be in near equipartition with the thermal energy. This result has important implications for the spectra of accretion disks and their stability.},

title = {Comparison of spectral slopes of magnetohydrodynamic and hydrodynamic  turbulence and measurements of alignment effects},
abstract = { We performed a series of high-resolution (up to 1024^3) direct numerical simulations of hydro and MHD strong turbulence. We found that for simulations with normal viscosity the slopes for spectra of MHD are similar, although slightly more shallower than for hydro simulations. However, for simulations with hyperviscosity the slopes were very different, for instance, the slopes for hydro simulations showed pronounced and well-defined bottleneck effect, while the MHD slopes were relatively much less affected. We believe that this is indicative of MHD strong turbulence being less local than Kolmogorov turbulence. This calls for revision of MHD strong turbulence models that assume local "as-in-hydro case" cascading. Nonlocality of MHD turbulence casts doubt on numerical determination of the slopes with currently available (512^3-1024^3) numerical resolutions, including simulations with normal viscosity. We also measure various so-called alignment effects and discuss their influence on the turbulent cascade. },

abstract = {We study damping of the axisymmetric magnetic shear instability by ohmic diffusion in accretion disks. The dispersion relation for axisymmetric perturbations in a magnetized disk is derived, including the effects of ohmic diffusion. The instability is damped when the diffusion rate is greater than the growth rate of the instability. We calculate the critical value of the diffusion coefficient at which the instability is suppressed. Comparing the critical value with the ohmic diffusion coefficients in different types of disks, we find that ohmic diffusion can damp the instability in the solar nebula (late stage of a protostellar disk) in which the conductivity is low, particularly in its middle region where neither thermal nor cosmic-ray ionizations are efficient. The damping is not significant in accretion disks around neutron stars, stellar black holes, massive black holes, or white dwarfs.},

Generally this number is very small in standard accretion disk models, but it can become larger than unity within ~50 Schwarzschild radii of the central mass. Recent numerical investigations suggest a marked dependence of the level of MHD turbulence on the value of the Prandtl number. Hence, black hole and neutron star accretors, i.e., compact X-ray sources, are affected. The astrophysical consequences of this could be significant, including a possible route to understanding the mysterious state changes that have long characterized these sources.},

title = {Local Hydrodynamic Stability of Accretion Disks},
abstract = {We employ a variety of numerical simulations in the local shearing box system to investigate in greater depth the local hydrodynamic stability of Keplerian differential rotation. In particular, we explore the relationship of Keplerian shear to the nonlinear instabilities known to exist in simple Cartesian shear. The Coriolis force is the source of linear stabilization in differential rotation. We exploit the formal equivalence of constant angular momentum flows and simple Cartesian shear to examine the transition from stability to nonlinear instability. The manifestation of nonlinear instability in simple shear flows is known to be sensitive to initial perturbation and the amount of viscosity; marginally (linearly) stable differentially rotating flows exhibit this same sensitivity. Keplerian systems, however, are completely stable; stabilizing Coriolis forces easily overwhelm any destabilizing nonlinear effects. If anything, nonlinear effects speed the decay of applied turbulence by producing a rapid cascade of energy to high wavenumbers where dissipation occurs. We test our conclusions with grid-resolution experiments and by comparing the results of codes with very different diffusive properties. The detailed agreement of the decay of nonlinear disturbances found repeatedly in codes with very different diffusive behaviors strongly suggests that Keplerian stability is not a numerical artifact. The properties of hydrodynamic differential rotation are contrasted with magnetohydrodynamic differential rotation. A kinetic stress tensor couples to the outwardly increasing vorticity, which limits turbulence; a magnetic stress couples to the outwardly decreasing shear, which promotes turbulence. Thus magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is uniquely capable of acting as a turbulent angular momentum transport mechanism in disks.},

The magnetorotational instability gives rise to flow turbulence, and quantitative chaos parameters, such as the largest Lyapunov exponent, can be measured. Linear growth rates appear in these exponents even when the flow is fully turbulent. The extreme sensitivity to initial conditions associated with chaotic flows has practical implications, the most important of which is that hundreds of orbital times are needed to extract a meaningful average for the stress.

title = {Dust Settling in Magnetorotationally-Driven Turbulent Discs I: Numerical  Methods and Evidence for a Vigorous Streaming Instability},
abstract = { (Abridged) In this paper we have used the RIEMANN code for computational astrophysics to study the interaction of a realistic distribution of dust grains with gas in a vertically stratified protostellar accretion disc. The disc was modeled to have the density and temperature of a minimum mass solar nebula, and was driven to a fully-developed turbulence via the magnetorotational instability (MRI). We find that the inclusion of standard dust to gas ratios does not have any significant effect on the MRI even when the dust sediments to the midplane of the accretion disc. The density distribution of the dust reaches a Gaussian profile, and the scale heights for the dust that we derive are shown to be proportional to the reciprocal of the square root of the dust radius. The largest dust shows a strong tendency to settle to the midplane of the accretion disc, and tends to organize itself into elongated clumps of high density. The dynamics of these clumps is shown to be consistent with a streaming instability. The streaming instability is seen to be very vigorous and persistent once it forms. Each stream of high density dust displays a reduced RMS velocity dispersion, and the densest clumpings of large dust are shown to form where the streams intersect. We have also shown that the mean free path and collision time for the dust that participates in the streaming instability is reduced by almost two orders of magnitude relative to the average mean free paths and collision times. We show that some of the large dust in our 10 au simulations should have a propensity for grain coalescence. },

title = {Global Three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Black Hole Accretion Disks: X-Ray Flares in the Plunging Region},
abstract = {We present the results of three-dimensional global resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of black hole accretion flows. General relativistic effects are simulated by using the pseudo-Newtonian potential. The initial state is an equilibrium model of a torus threaded by weak toroidal magnetic fields. As the magnetorotational instability (MRI) grows in the torus, mass accretes to the black hole by losing angular momentum. We found that in the innermost plunging region, nonaxisymmetric accretion flow creates bisymmetric spiral magnetic fields and current sheets. Mass accretion along the spiral channel creates one-armed spiral density distribution. Since the accreting matter carries in magnetic fields that are subsequently stretched and amplified as a result of differential rotation, current density increases inside the channel. Magnetic reconnection taking place in the current sheet produces slow-mode shock waves that propagate away from the reconnection site. Magnetic energy release in the innermost plunging region could be the origin of X-ray shots observed in black hole candidates. Numerical simulations reproduced soft X-ray excess preceding the peak of the shots, X-ray hardening at the peak of the shot, and hard X-ray time lags.},

title = {Semi-global simulations of the magneto-rotational instability in core  collapse supernovae},
abstract = { Possible effects of magnetic fields in core collapse supernovae rely on an efficient amplification of the weak pre-collapse fields. The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) has been suggested to lead to rapid field growth. Although MRI studies exist for accretion discs, the application of their results to core collapse supernovae is inhibited as the physics of supernova cores is substantially different from that of accretion discs. We address the problem of growth and saturation of the MRI by means of semi-global simulations, which combine elements of global and local simulations by taking into account the presence of global background gradients and using a local computational grid. We analyze the dispersion relation of the MRI to identify different regimes of the instability. This analysis is complemented by simulations, where we consider a local computational box rotating at sub-Keplerian velocity, and where we allow for a radial entropy gradient. We identify six regimes of the MRI depending on the ratio of the entropy and angular velocity gradient. Our numerical models confirm the instability criteria and growth rates for all relevant regimes. The MRI grows exponentially within milliseconds the flow and magnetic field geometries being dominated by channel flows. The MRI growth ceases once the channels are disrupted by resistive instabilities (due to finite numerical conductivity), and MHD turbulence sets in. From an analysis of the growth rates of the resistive instabilities, we deduce scaling laws for the termination amplitude of the MRI which agree well with our numerical models. We determine the dependence of the development of coherent flow structures in the saturated state on the aspect ratio of the simulation boxes. [abbreviated] },

title = {Thermal Equilibria of Magnetically Supported, Black Hole Accretion Disks},
abstract = { We present new thermal equilibrium solutions for optically thin and thick disks incorporating magnetic fields. The purpose of this paper is to explain the bright hard state and the bright/slow transition observed in the rising phases of outbursts in BHCs. On the basis of the results of 3D MHD simulations, we assume that magnetic fields inside the disk are turbulent and dominated by the azimuthal component and that the azimuthally averaged Maxwell stress is proportional to the total pressure. We prescribe the magnetic flux advection rate to determine the azimuthal magnetic flux at a given radius.  We find magnetically supported, thermally stable solutions for both optically thin and thick disks, in which the heating enhanced by the strong magnetic field balances the radiative cooling. The temperature in a low-{\$}\beta{\$} disk is lower than that in an ADAF/RIAF but higher than that in a standard disk. We also study the radial dependence of the thermal equilibrium solutions.  The optically thin, low-{\$}\beta{\$} branch extends to {\$} \dot M \gtrsim 0.1 {\dot M}_{\rm Edd}{\$}, in which the temperature anti-correlates with the mass accretion rate. Thus optically thin low-{\$}\beta{\$} disks can explain the bright hard state. Optically thick, low-{\$}\beta{\$} disks have the radial dependence of the effective temperature {\$}T_{\rm eff} \propto \varpi^{-3/4}{\$}. Such disks will be observed as staying in a high/soft state. Furthermore, limit cycle oscillations between an optically thick low-{\$}\beta{\$} disk and a slim disk will occur because the optically thick low-{\$}\beta{\$} branch intersects with the radiation pressure dominated standard disk branch. These limit cycle oscillations will show a smaller luminosity variation than that between a standard disk and a slim disk. },

title = {Three Dimensional Simulations of Vertical Magnetic Flux in the Immediate  Vicinity of Black Holes},
abstract = { This article reports on three-dimensional (3-D) MHD simulations of non-rotating and rapidly rotating black holes and the adjacent black hole accretion disk magnetospheres. A particular emphasis is placed on the vertical magnetic flux that is advected inward from large radii and threads the equatorial plane near the event horizon. In both cases of non-rotating and rotating black holes, the existence of a significant vertical magnetic field in this region is like a switch that creates powerful jets. There are many similarities in the vertical flux dynamics in these two cases in spite of the tremendous enhancement of azimuthal twisting of the field lines and enhancement of the jet power because of an "ergospheric disk" in the Kerr metric. A 3-D approach is essential because two-dimensional axisymmetric flows are incapable of revealing the nature of vertical flux near a black hole. Poloidal field lines from the ergospheric accretion region have been visualized in 3-D and much of the article is devoted to a formal classification of the different manifestations of vertical flux in the Kerr case. },

title = {Towards a new standard model for black hole accretion},
abstract = {We briefly review recent developments in black hole accretion disk theory, emphasizing the vital role played by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stresses in transporting angular momentum. The apparent universality of accretion-related outflow phenomena is a strong indicator that large-scale MHD torques facilitate vertical transport of angular momentum. This leads to an enhanced overall rate of angular momentum transport and allows accretion of matter to proceed at an interesting rate. Furthermore, we argue that when vertical transport is important, the radial structure of the accretion disk is modified at small radii and this affects the disk emission spectrum. We present a simple model demonstrating how energetic, magnetically-driven outflows modify the emergent disk emission spectrum with respect to that predicted by standard accretion disk theory. A comparison of the predicted spectra against observations of quasar spectral energy distributions suggests that mass accretion rates inferred using the standard disk model may be severely underestimated.},

abstract = {The nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in weakly ionized accretion disks, including the effect of the Hall term and ohmic dissipation, is investigated using local three-dimensional MHD simulations and various initial magnetic field geometries. When the magnetic Reynolds number, ReM≡v2A/ηΩ (where vA is the Alfv{\'e}n speed, η is the magnetic diffusivity, and Ω is the angular frequency), is initially larger than a critical value ReM,crit, the MRI evolves into MHD turbulence in which angular momentum is transported efficiently by the Maxwell stress. If ReM<ReM,crit, however, ohmic dissipation suppresses the MRI, and the stress is reduced by several orders of magnitude. The critical value is in the range of 1-30 depending on the initial field configuration. The Hall effect does not modify the critical magnetic Reynolds number by much but enhances the saturation level of the Maxwell stress by a factor of a few. We show that the saturation level of the MRI is characterized by v2Az/ηΩ, where vAz is the Alfv{\'e}n speed in the nonlinear regime along the vertical component of the field. The condition for turbulence and significant transport is given by v2Az/ηΩ>~1, and this critical value is independent of the strength and geometry of the magnetic field or the size of the Hall term. If the magnetic field strength in an accretion disk can be estimated observationally and the magnetic Reynolds number v2A/ηΩ is larger than about 30, this would imply that the MRI is operating in the disk.},

title = {Layered Accretion in T Tauri Disks},
abstract = {We put forward a model for accretion disks around T Tauri stars. The model assumes that angular momentum transport is driven by magnetic fields and can occur only in those parts of the disk that are sufficiently ionized that the gas can couple to the magnetic field. These regions lie at R ≲ 0.1 AU, where collisional ionization is effective, and at R ≲ 0.1 AU in a layer of thickness ≍ 100 g cm-2 at the surface of the disk where cosmic-ray ionization is effective. The model predicts that the stellar accretion rate is about 10-8 Msun yr-1, independent of the rate of infall onto the disk. Matter that is not accreted onto the star accumulates in the inner few AU of the disk at a rate of about 10-3 Msun in 104 yr. Given this buildup it is unlikely that accretion is steady. The effective temperature profile is Te ∼ r-1/2 outside of 0.1 AU, which differs from the canonical Te ∼ r-3/4. We calculate the expected spectral energy distribution for the disk and show that this temperature profile produces an infrared excess. Finally, we discuss some of the leading uncertainties in the theory.},

A sampling of results from both Newtonian 3-d shearing box and general relativistic global disk MHD simulations is reported. Among other things, these simulations have shown that: contrary to long-held assumptions, stress is continuous through the marginally stable and plunging regions around black holes, so that rotating black holes can give substantial amounts of angular momentum electromagnetically to surrounding matter; the upper layers of accretion disks are primarily supported by magnetic pressure, potentially leading to interesting departures from local black-body emitted spectra; and initially local magnetic fields in accretion flows can, in some cases, spontaneously generate large-scale fields that connect rotating black holes to infinity and mediate strong relativistic jets.},

This prescription is based on a direct relationship between the angular momentum transport in a thin accretion disk and the disk cooling in a steady state. Assuming that opacity is dominated by dust we are able to self-consistently derive disk properties for a given {\$}\dot M{\$} assuming marginal gravitational stability. We also allow external irradiation of the disk and account for a non-zero background viscosity which can be due to the MRI. Spatial transitions between different co-existing disk states (e.g. between irradiated and self-luminous or between gravitoturbulent and viscous) are described and the location of the boundary at which disk must fragment is determined in a variety of situations. We demonstrate in particular that at low enough {\$}\dot M{\$} external irradiation stabilizes gravitoturbulent disk against fragmentation all the way to infinity thus providing means of steady mass transport to the central object. Implications of our results for the possibility of planet formation by gravitational instability in protoplanetary disks and star formation in the Galactic Center and for the problem of feeding supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei are discussed. },

Our two-dimensional, axisymmetric models incorporate full vertical structure with a new treatment of the radiative boundary condition for the disk photosphere. We find that FU Ori-type outbursts can be explained by a slow accumulation of matter due to gravitational instability. Eventually this triggers the magnetorotational instability, which leads to rapid accretion. The thermal instability is triggered in the inner disk but this instability is not necessary for the outburst. An accurate disk vertical structure, including convection, is important for understanding the outburst behavior. Large convective eddies develop during the high state in the inner disk. The models are in agreement with Spitzer IRS spectra and also with peak accretion rates and decay timescales of observed outbursts, though some objects show faster rise timescale. We also propose that convection may account for the observed mild-supersonic turbulence and the short-timescale variations of FU Orionis objects. },

abstract = { The aim of this paper is to study the vertical profile of small dust particles in protoplanetary discs in which angular momentum transport is due to MHD turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability. We consider particle sizes that range from approximately 1 micron up to a few millimeters.We use a grid-based MHD code to perform global two-fluid simulations of turbulent protoplanetary discs which contain dust grains of various sizes. In quasi-steady state, the gravitational settling of dust particles is balanced by turbulent diffusion. Simple and standard models of this process fail to describe accurately the vertical profile of the dust density. The disagreement is larger for small dust particles (of a few microns in size), especially in the disc upper layers ({\$}Z>3H{\$}, where {\$}H{\$} is the scale-height). Here there can be orders of magnitude in the disagreement between the simple model predictions and the simulation results. This is because MHD turbulence is not homogeneous in accretion discs, since velocity fluctuations increase significantly in the disc upper layer where a strongly magnetized corona develops. We provide an alternative model that gives a better fit to the simulations. In this model, dust particles are diffused away from the midplane by MHD turbulence, but the diffusion coefficient varies vertically and is everywhere proportional to the square of the local turbulent vertical velocity fluctuations. The spatial distribution of dust particles can be used to trace the properties of MHD turbulence in protoplanetary discs, such as the amplitude of the velocity fluctuations. In the future, detailed and direct comparison between numerical simulations and observations should prove a useful tool for constraining the properties of turbulence in protoplanetary discs. },

abstract = {We examine whether massive-star accretion discs are likely to fragment due to self-gravity. Rapid accretion and high angular momentum push these discs toward fragmentation, whereas viscous heating and the high protostellar luminosity stabilize them. We find that for a broad range of protostar masses and for reasonable accretion times, massive discs larger than ~150au are prone to fragmentation. We develop an analytical estimate for the angular momentum of accreted material, extending the analysis of Matzner {\&} Levin to account for strongly turbulent initial conditions. In a core-collapse model, we predict that discs are marginally prone to fragmentation around stars of about 4-15Msolar - even if we adopt conservative estimates of the discs' radii and tendency to fragment. More massive stars are progressively more likely to fragment, and there is a sharp drop in the stability of disc accretion at the very high accretion rates expected above 110Msolar. Fragmentation may starve accretion in massive stars, especially above this limit, and is likely to create swarms of small, coplanar companions.},

abstract = { A higher order Godunov method for the radiation subsystem of radiation hydrodynamics is presented. A key ingredient of the method is the direct coupling of stiff source term effects to the hyperbolic structure of the system of conservation laws; it is composed of a predictor step that is based on Duhamel's principle and a corrector step that is based on Picard iteration. The method is second order accurate in both time and space, unsplit, asymptotically preserving, and uniformly well behaved from the photon free streaming (hyperbolic) limit through the weak equilibrium diffusion (parabolic) limit and to the strong equilibrium diffusion (hyperbolic) limit. Numerical tests demonstrate second order convergence across various parameter regimes. },

title = {MHD simulations of the magnetorotational instability in a shearing box with zero net flux. I. The issue of convergence},
abstract = {Aims.We study the properties of MHD turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in accretion disks. To do this we perform a series of numerical simulations for which the resolution is gradually increased. Methods: We adopt the local shearing box model and focus on the special case for which the initial magnetic flux threading the disk vanishes. We employ the finite difference code ZEUS to evolve the ideal MHD equations. Results: Performing a set of numerical simulations in a fixed computational domain with increasing resolution, we demonstrate that turbulent activity decreases as resolution increases. The highest resolution considered is 256 grid cells per scale height. We quantify the turbulent activity by measuring the rate of angular momentum transport through evaluating the standard α parameter. We find α = 0.004 when (N_x,N_y,N_z) = (64,100,64), α = 0.002 when (N_x,N_y,N_z) = (128,200,128) and α = 0.001 when (N_x,N_y,N_z) = (256,400,256). This steady decline is an indication that numerical dissipation, occurring at the grid scale is an important determinant of the saturated form of the MHD turbulence. Analysing the results in Fourier space, we demonstrate that this is due to the MRI forcing significant flow energy all the way down to the grid dissipation scale. We also use our results to study the properties of the numerical dissipation in ZEUS. Its amplitude is characterised by the magnitude of an effective magnetic Reynolds number ReM which increases from 104 to 105 as the number of grid points is increased from 64 to 256 per scale height. Conclusions: The simulations we have carried out do not produce results that are independent of the numerical dissipation scale, even at the highest resolution studied. Thus it is important to use physical dissipation, both viscous and resistive, and to quantify contributions from numerical effects, when performing numerical simulations of MHD turbulence with zero net flux in accretion disks at the resolutions normally considered.},

title = {Exact shearing box solutions of magnetohydrodynamic flows with resistivity, viscosity and cooling},
abstract = {Axisymmetric incompressible modes of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) with a vertical wavenumber are exact solutions of the non-linear local equations of motion for a disc (shearing box). They are referred to as `channel solutions'. Here, we generalize a class of these solutions to include energy losses, viscous, and resistive effects. In the limit of zero shear, we recover the result that torsional Alfv{\'e}n waves are exact solutions of the non-linear equations. Our method allows the extension of these solutions into the dissipative regime. These new solutions serve as benchmarks for simulations including dissipation and energy loss, and to calibrate numerical viscosity and resistivity in the ZEUS3D code. We quantify the anisotropy of numerical dissipation and compute its scaling with time and space resolution. We find a strong dependence of the dissipation on the mean magnetic field that may affect the saturation state of the MRI as computed with ZEUS3D. It is also shown that elongated grid cells generally preclude isotropic dissipation and that a Courant time-step smaller than that which is commonly used should be taken to avoid spurious anti-diffusion of magnetic field.},

title = {On self-sustained dynamo cycles in accretion discs},
abstract = {Context: MHD turbulence is known to exist in shearing boxes with either zero or nonzero net magnetic flux. However, the way turbulence survives in the zero-net-flux case is not explained by linear theory and appears as a purely numerical result that is not well understood. This type of turbulence is also related to the possibility of having a dynamo action in accretion discs, which may help to generate the large-scale magnetic field required by ejection processes. Aims: We look for a nonlinear mechanism able to explain the persistence of MHD turbulence in shearing boxes with zero net magnetic flux, and potentially leading to large-scale dynamo action. Methods: Spectral nonlinear simulations of the magnetorotational instability are shown to exhibit a large-scale axisymmetric magnetic field, maintained for a few orbits. The generation process of this field is investigated using the results of the simulations and an inhomogeneous linear approach. We show that quasilinear nonaxisymmetric waves may provide a positive back-reaction on the large-scale field when a weak inhomogeneous azimuthal field is present, explaining the behaviour of the simulations. We finally reproduce the dynamo cycles using a simple closure model summarising our linear results. Results: The mechanism by which turbulence is sustained in zero-net-flux shearing boxes is shown to be related to the existence of a large-scale azimuthal field, surviving for several orbits. In particular, it is shown that MHD turbulence in shearing boxes can be seen as a dynamo process coupled to a magnetorotational-type instability.},

abstract = {The dynamics of planetesimals and planetary cores may be strongly influenced by density perturbations driven by magneto-rotational turbulence in their natal protoplanetary gas disks. Using the local shearing box approximation, we perform numerical simulations of planetesimals moving as massless particles in a turbulent, magnetized, unstratified gas disk. Our fiducial disk model shows turbulent accretion characterized by a Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter of α ~ 10-2, with rms density perturbations of ~10%. We measure the statistical evolution of particle orbital properties in our simulations including mean radius, eccentricity, and velocity dispersion. We confirm random walk growth in time of all three properties, the first time that this has been done with direct orbital integration in a local model. We find that the growth rate increases with the box size used at least up to boxes of eight scale heights in horizontal size. However, even our largest boxes show velocity dispersions sufficiently low that collisional destruction of planetesimals should be unimportant in the inner disk throughout its lifetime. Our direct integrations agree with earlier torque measurements showing that type I migration dominates over diffusive migration by stochastic torques for most objects in the planetary core and terrestrial planet mass range. Diffusive migration remains important for objects in the mass range of kilometer-sized planetesimals. Discrepancies in the derived magnitude of turbulence between local and global simulations of magneto-rotationally unstable disks remains an open issue, with important consequences for planet formation scenarios.},

We consider the situation when the disc is stable to convection in the absence of the magnetic field. The most robust buoyancy driven unstable modes, which occur when the field is strong enough, have low azimuthal mode number m. They grow exponentially, apparently belonging to a discrete spectrum. They exist for the dimensionless ratio epsilon/(H^2Omega) smaller than ~10^-2, where Omega is the angular velocity and H is the disc semithickness. In contrast the magnetorotational modes develop arbitrarily small radial scale and show transient amplification as expected from a shearing sheet analysis. The most robust modes of this type are local in all directions. Because of their more global character, the buoyancy driven modes may be important for the generation of large-scale fields and outflows.},

abstract = { Black-hole accretion systems are known to possess several distinct modes (or spectral states), such as low/hard state, high/soft state, and so on. Since the dynamics of the corresponding flows is distinct, theoretical models were separately discussed for each state. We here propose a unified model based on our new, global, two-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations. By controlling a density normalization we could for the first time reproduce three distinct modes of accretion flow and outflow with one numerical code. When the density is large (model A), a geometrically thick, very luminous disk forms, in which photon trapping takes place. When the density is moderate (model B), the accreting gas can effectively cool by emitting radiation, thus generating a thin disk, i.e., the soft-state disk. When the density is too low for radiative cooling to be important (model C), a disk becomes hot, thick, and faint; i.e., the hard-state disk. The magnetic energy is amplified within the disk up to about twice, 30%, and 20% of the gas energy in models A, B, and C, respectively. Notably, the disk outflows with helical magnetic fields, which are driven either by radiation pressure force or magnetic pressure force, are ubiquitous in any accretion modes. Finally, our simulations are consistent with the phenomenological alpha-viscosity prescription, that is, the disk viscosity is proportional to the pressure. },

We show that much of the dead zone nevertheless is active and flows toward the star while smooth, large-scale magnetic fields transfer the orbital angular momentum radially outward. Stellar X-ray and radionuclide ionization sustain a weak coupling of the dead zone gas to the magnetic fields, despite the rapid recombination of free charges on dust grains. Net radial magnetic fields are generated in the magnetorotational turbulence in the electrically conducting top and bottom surface layers of the disk, and reach the midplane by ohmic diffusion. A toroidal component to the fields is produced near the midplane by the orbital shear. The process is similar to the magnetization of the solar tachocline. The result is a laminar, magnetically driven accretion flow in the region where the planets form.},

A simple cooling law with a constant cooling time is adopted, such that the disc settles down into a quasi-steady gravitoturbulent state. In this state, vortices appear as transient structures undergoing recurring phases of formation, growth to sizes comparable to a local Jeans scale and eventual shearing and destruction due to the combined effects of self-gravity and background Keplerian shear. Each phase typically lasts about 2 orbital periods or less. As a result, in self-gravitating discs the overall dynamical picture of vortex evolution is irregular consisting of many transient vortices at different evolutionary stages and, therefore, with various sizes up to the local Jeans scale. Vortices generate density waves during evolution, which turn into shocks. Therefore, the dynamics of density waves and vortices are coupled implying that, in general, one should consider both vortex and spiral density wave modes in order to get a proper understanding of self-gravitating disc dynamics. Our results suggest that given such an irregular and rapidly varying character of vortex evolution in self-gravitating discs, it may be difficult for such vortices to effectively trap dust particles. Further study of the behaviour of dust particles embedded in a self-gravitating gaseous disc is, however, required to strengthen this conclusion. },

abstract = {We investigate the conditions for the presence of a magnetically inactive dead zone in protostellar disks using three-dimensional shearing-box MHD calculations, including vertical stratification, ohmic resistivity, and time-dependent ionization chemistry. Activity driven by the magneto-rotational instability fills the whole thickness of the disk at 5 AU, provided cosmic-ray ionization is present, small grains are absent, and the gas-phase metal abundance is sufficiently high. At 1 AU, the larger column density of 1700 g cm-2 means the midplane is shielded from ionizing particles and remains magneto-rotationally stable, even under the most favorable conditions considered. Nevertheless, the dead zone is effectively eliminated. Turbulence mixes free charges into the interior as they recombine, leading to a slight coupling of the midplane gas to the magnetic fields. Weak, large-scale radial fields diffuse to the midplane, where they are sheared out to produce stronger azimuthal fields. On average, the resulting midplane accretion stresses are just a few times less than in the surface layers.},

The growth of many short-wavelength MRI modes, which are called ``channel flows'', is found in the spatial distribution of the current density. These small channel flows can be regarded as a unit structure of MRI driven turbulence. Nonlinear evolution of the channel flow affects the saturation amplitude and time variability of the Maxwell stress. Exponential growth of a channel mode is stopped by the Kelvin-Helmholtz type instability which triggers the subsequent magnetic reconnection. The characteristics of the magnetic reconnection are consistent with the Sweet-Parker model.

title = {Grain Retention and Formation of Planetesimals near the Snow Line in MRI-driven Turbulent Protoplanetary Disks},
abstract = {The first challenge in the formation of both terrestrial planets and the cores of gas giants is the retention of grains in protoplanetary disks. In most regions of these disks, gas attains sub-Keplerian speeds as a consequence of a negative pressure gradient. Hydrodynamic drag leads to orbital decay and depletion of the solid material in the disk, with characteristic timescales as short as only a few hundred years for meter-sized objects at 1 AU. In this Letter, we suggest a particle retention mechanism that promotes the accumulation of grains and the formation of planetesimals near the water sublimation front or ``snow line.'' This model is based on the assumption that, in the regions most interesting for planet formation, the viscous evolution of the disk is due to turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the surface layers of the disk. The depth to which MRI effectively generates turbulence is a strong function of grain size and abundance. A sharp increase in the grain-to-gas density ratio across the snow line reduces the column depth of the active layer. As the disk evolves toward a quasi-steady state, this change in the active layer creates a local maximum in radial distribution of the gas surface density and pressure, causing the gas to rotate at super-Keplerian speed and halting the inward migration of grains. This scenario presents a robust process for grain retention that may aid in the formation of proto-gas giant cores preferentially near the snow line.},

title = {Nonlinear Evolution of Hydrodynamical Shear Flows in Two Dimensions},
abstract = {We examine how perturbed shear flows evolve in two-dimensional, incompressible, inviscid hydrodynamical fluids, with the ultimate goal of understanding the dynamics of accretion disks. To linear order, vorticity waves are swung around by the background shear, and their velocities are amplified transiently before decaying. It has been speculated that sufficiently amplified modes might couple nonlinearly, leading to turbulence. Here we show how nonlinear coupling occurs in two dimensions, focusing on the interaction between an axisymmetric mode and a swinging mode. We find that all axisymmetric modes, regardless of how small in amplitude, are unstable when they interact with swinging modes that have sufficiently large azimuthal wavelength. Quantitatively, the criterion for instability is that |ky,sw/kx,axi|<~|ω/q|, i.e., that the ratio of wavenumbers (swinging azimuthal wavenumber to axisymmetric radial wavenumber) is less than the ratio of the perturbed vorticity to the background vorticity. If this is the case, then when the swinging mode is in mid-swing it couples with the axisymmetric mode to produce a new leading swinging mode that has larger vorticity than itself; this new mode in turn produces an even larger leading mode, etc. We explain how this shear (or Kelvin-Helmholtz) instability operates in real space as well. The instability occurs whenever the momentum transported by an energy-conserving perturbation opposes the background shear; only when this occurs can energy be extracted from the mean flow and hence added to the perturbation. For an accretion disk, this means that the instability transports angular momentum outward while it operates. We verify all our conclusions in detail with pseudospectral numerical simulations. Simulations of the instability form vortices whose boundaries become highly convoluted.},

title = {Local shear instabilities in weakly ionized, weakly magnetized disks},
abstract = {We extend the analysis of axisymmetric magnetic shear instabilities from ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows to weakly ionized plasmas with coupling between ions and neutrals caused by collisions, ionization, and recombination. As part of the analysis, we derive the single-fluid MHD dispersion relation without invoking the Boussinesq approximation. This work expands the range of applications of these instabilities from fully ionized accretion disks to molecular disks in galaxies and, with somewhat more uncertainty, to protostellar disks. Instability generally requires the angular velocity to decrease outward, the magnetic field strengths to be subthermal, and the ions and neutrals to be sufficiently well coupled. If ionization and recombination processes can be neglected on an orbital timescale, adequate coupling is achieved when the collision frequency of a given neutral with the ions exceeds the local epicyclic freqency. When ionization equilibrium is maintained on an orbital timescale, a new feature is present in the disk dynamics: in contrast to a single-fluid system, subthermal azimuthal fields can affect the axisymmetric stability of weakly ionized two-fluid systems. We discuss the underlying causes for this behavior. Azimuthal fields tend to be stabilizing under these circumstances, and good coupling between the neutrals and ions requires the collision frequency to exceed the epicyclic frequency by a potentially large secant factor related to the magnetic field geometry. When the instability is present, subthermal azimuthal fields may also reduce the growth rate unless the collision frequency is high, but this is important only if the field strengths are very subthermal and/or the azimuthal field is the dominant field component. We briefly discuss our results in the context of the Galactic center circumnuclear disk, and suggest that the shear instability might be present there, and be responsible for the observed turbulent motions.},

In the astrophysical context this generation is usually explained by a self-excited dynamo, which involves flows that can amplify a weak `seed' magnetic field exponentially fast. Particular emphasis is placed on the nonlinear saturation of the dynamo. Analytic and numerical results are discussed both for small scale dynamos, which are completely isotropic, and for large scale dynamos, where some form of parity breaking is crucial. Central to the discussion of large scale dynamos is the so-called alpha effect which explains the generation of a mean field if the turbulence lacks mirror symmetry, i.e. if the flow has kinetic helicity. Large scale dynamos produce small scale helical fields as a waste product that quench the large scale dynamo and hence the alpha effect. With this in mind, the microscopic theory of the alpha effect is revisited in full detail and recent results for the loss of helical magnetic fields are reviewed.},

title = {Parasitic instabilities in magnetized, differentially rotating disks},
abstract = {Velikhov, Chandrasekhar, Balbus {\&} Hawley have discovered a MHD instability of differentially rotating fluids that may explain the effective viscosity of accretion disks. If the unperturbed magnetic energy density is much less than the gas pressure, this `magnetorotational' instability (MRI) arises on small scales and is approximately incompressible. If the unperturbed field is suffiently, strong, the MRI is suppressed. We therefore ask whether the MRI mechanism can amplify even very weak initial fields until they reach equipartition with the gas pressure. We show that in the total incompressible limit, the MRI modes are exact solutions of the nonlinear fluid equations, even if the perturbed magnetic field is much larger than the unperturbed field. Also, we present a new exact solution in the opposite limit that the magnetic pressure is much larger than that of the gas. On the other hand, we show that the incompressible MRI modes are themselves subject to parasitic instabilities with instantaneous growth rates proportional to the MRI amplitude. Some of the parasitic instabilities are of the Kelvin-Helmholtz type, while others are less familiar. The eigenfunctions of the latter group suggest that they may promote rapid reconnection of the MRI field. Thus, parasitic modes may stop MRI growth at subequipartition amplitudes if it developes from a sufficiently weak initital field.},

title = {Thermodynamics of an Accretion Disk Annulus with Comparable Radiation and Gas Pressure},
abstract = {We explore the thermodynamic and global structural properties of a local patch of an accretion disk whose parameters were chosen so that radiation pressure and gas pressure would be comparable in magnitude. Heating, radiative transport, and cooling are computed self-consistently with the structure by solving the equations of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the shearing-box approximation. Using a fully three-dimensional and energy-conserving code, we compute the structure and energy balance of this disk segment over a span of more than 40 cooling times. As is also true when gas pressure dominates, the disk's upper atmosphere is magnetically supported. However, unlike the gas-dominated case, no steady state is reached; instead, the total (i.e., radiation plus gas) energy content fluctuates by factors of 3-4 over timescales of several tens of orbits, with no secular trend. Because the radiation pressure varies much more than the gas pressure, the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure varies over the range ~=0.5-2. The volume-integrated dissipation rate generally increases with increasing total energy, but the mean trend is somewhat slower than linear, and the instantaneous dissipation rate is often a factor of 2 larger or smaller than the mean for that total energy level. Locally, the dissipation rate per unit volume scales approximately in proportion to the current density; the time-averaged dissipation rate per unit mass is proportional to m-1/2, where m is the horizontally averaged mass column density to the nearer of the top or bottom surface. As in our earlier study of a gas-dominated shearing box, we find that energy transport is completely dominated by radiative diffusion, with Poynting flux carrying less than 1% of the energy lost from the box.},

The use of solutions to the Riemann problem, in conjunction with the limiting of some of the second-order terms, yields correct behavior at discontinuities.

title = {Locality of MHD Turbulence in Isothermal Disks},
abstract = {We numerically evolve turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in a three-dimensional, unstratified shearing box and study its structure using two-point correlation functions. We confirm Fromang and Papaloizou's result that shearing box models with zero net magnetic flux are not converged; the dimensionless shear stress α is proportional to the grid scale. We find that the two-point correlation of \mbox{\boldmath B} shows that it is composed of narrow filaments that are swept back by differential rotation into a trailing spiral. The correlation lengths along each of the correlation function principal axes decrease monotonically with the grid scale. For mean azimuthal field models, which we argue are more relevant to astrophysical disks than the zero net field models, we find that: α increases weakly with increasing resolution at fixed box size; α increases slightly as the box size is increased; α increases linearly with net field strength, confirming earlier results; the two-point correlation function of the magnetic field is resolved and converged, and is composed of narrow filaments swept back by the shear; the major axis of the two-point increases slightly as the box size is increased; these results are code independent, based on a comparison of ATHENA and ZEUS runs. The velocity, density, and magnetic fields decorrelate over scales larger than ~H, as do the dynamical terms in the magnetic energy evolution equations. We conclude that MHD turbulence in disks is localized, subject to the limitations imposed by the absence of vertical stratification, the use of an isothermal equation of state, finite box size, finite run time, and finite resolution.},

abstract = { This paper concerns the interaction between non-axisymmetric inertial waves and their corotation resonances in a hydrodynamical disk. Inertial waves are of interest because they can localise in resonant cavities circumscribed by Lindblad radii, and as a consequence exhibit discrete oscillation frequencies that may be observed. It is often hypothesised that these trapped eigenmodes are affiliated with the poorly understood QPO phenomenon. We demonstrate that a large class of non-axisymmetric 3D inertial waves cannot manifest as trapped normal modes. This class includes any inertial wave whose resonant cavity contains a corotation singularity. Instead, these `singular' modes constitute a continuous spectrum and, as an ensemble, are convected with the flow, giving rise to shearing waves. Lastly, we present a simple demonstration of how the corotation singularity stabilizes three-dimensional perturbations in a slender torus. },

title = {Tuned Finite-Difference Diffusion Operators},
abstract = { Finite-difference simulations of fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics generally require an explicit diffusion operator, either to maintain stability by attenuating grid-scale structure, or to implement physical diffusivities such as viscosity or resistivity. If the goal is stability only, the diffusion must act at the grid scale, but should affect structure at larger scales as little as possible. For physical diffusivities the diffusion scale depends on the problem, and diffusion may act at larger scales as well. Diffusivity undesirably limits the computational timestep in both cases. We construct tuned finite-difference diffusion operators that minimally limit the timestep while acting as desired near the diffusion scale. Such operators reach peak values at the diffusion scale rather than at the grid scale, but behave as standard operators at larger scales. We focus on the specific applications of hyperdiffusivity for numerical stabilization, and high Schmidt and high Prandtl number simulations where the diffusion scale greatly exceeds the grid scale. },

title = {Magnetic fields in protoplanetary disks},
abstract = {Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of protoplanetary disks. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular momentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of outflows from the disk surface. Magnetically-driven mixing has implications for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population, and the effective viscous response of the disk determines whether planets migrate inwards or outwards. However, the weak ionisation of protoplanetary disks means that magnetic fields may not be able to effectively couple to the matter. I examine the magnetic diffusivity in a minimum solar nebula model and present calculations of the ionisation equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk midplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the conductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have grown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields can begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are generally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while electrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the magnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas, except at the disk surfaces where the low density of neutrals permits the ions to remain attached to the field lines. For a standard population of 0.1 μm grains the active surface layers have a combined column Σactive≈2 g cm‑2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated to 3 μm, Σactive≈80 g cm‑2. Ionisation in the active layers is dominated by stellar X-rays. In the absence of grains, X-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (i.e. Σactive≈150 g cm‑2). At 5 AU the Σactive≈Σtotal once grains have aggregated to 1 μm in size.},

abstract = { In a weakly ionized plasma, the evolution of the magnetic field is described by a "generalized Ohm's law" that includes the Hall effect and the ambipolar diffusion terms. These terms introduce additional spatial and time scales which play a decisive role in the cascading and the dissipation mechanisms in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We determine the Kolmogorov dissipation scales for the viscous, the resistive and the ambipolar dissipation mechanisms. The plasma, depending on its properties and the energy injection rate, may preferentially select one of the these dissipation scales. thus determining the shortest spatial scale of the supposedly self-similar spectral distribution of the magnetic field. The results are illustrated taking the partially ionized part of the solar atmosphere as an example. Thus the shortest spatial scale of the supposedly self-similar spectral distribution of the solar magnetic field is determined by any of the four dissipation scales given by the viscosity, the Spizer resistivity (electron-ion collisions), the resistivity due to electron-neutral collisions and the ambipolar diffusivity. It is found that the ambipolar diffusion dominates for resonably large energy injection rate. The robustness of the magnetic helicity in the partially ionized solar atmosphere would facilitate the formation of self-organized vortical structures. },

The dynamics and evolution of accretion disks depend upon how angular momentum is transported outward from one fluid element to another. The nature of this process was unclear for many years. Since the early 1990s, however, considerable progress has been made in understanding how turbulence arises and transports angular momentum in astrophysical accretion disks. Accretion disks are generally highly conducting plasmas; the equations governing their evolution are those of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Although a hydrodynamical disk would be locally stable, the combination of a weak subthermal magnetic field and outwardly decreasing differential rotation rapidly generates magnetohydrodynamical turbulence via a remarkably simple linear instability. Thus, turbulent accretion disks are fundamentally magnetohydrodynamical in nature.},

title = {Local Axisymmetric Diffusive Stability of Weakly Magnetized, Differentially Rotating, Stratified Fluids},
abstract = {We study the local stability of stratified, differentially rotating fluids to axisymmetric perturbations in the presence of a weak magnetic field and of finite resistivity, viscosity, and heat conductivity. This is a generalization of the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) double-diffusive analysis to the magnetized and resistive, triple-diffusive case. Our fifth-order dispersion relation admits a novel branch that describes a magnetized version of multidiffusive modes. We derive necessary conditions for axisymmetric stability in the inviscid and perfect-conductor (double-diffusive) limits. In each case, rotation must be constant on cylinders and angular velocity must not decrease with distance from the rotation axis for stability, irrespective of the relative strength of viscous, resistive, and heat diffusion. Therefore, in both double-diffusive limits, solid-body rotation marginally satisfies our stability criteria. The role of weak magnetic fields is essential to reach these conclusions. The triple-diffusive situation is more complex, and its stability criteria are not easily stated. Numerical analysis of our general dispersion relation confirms our analytic double-diffusive criteria but also shows that an unstable double-diffusive situation can be significantly stabilized by the addition of a third, ostensibly weaker, diffusion process. We describe a numerical application to the Sun's upper radiative zone and establish that it would be subject to unstable multidiffusive modes if moderate or strong radial gradients of angular velocity were present.},

title = {Angular Momentum Transport in Accretion Disks via Convection},
abstract = {In this paper, we investigate, by three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, the role that vertical convective motions play in providing angular momentum transport in a Keplerian disk. We begin by deriving simple and general analytic constraints upon the correlated radial and azimuthal velocity fluctuation tensor, critical to the direction of energy and angular momentum transport. When azimuthal pressure gradients are small, as is often the case for incompressible turbulence in a shearing disk, the constraints are particularly straightforward and striking: they imply there can be no net outward transport in a steady flow. (More precisely, any steady transport that is present must be due to the explicit forcing by azimuthal pressure gradients.) Furthermore, numerical simulations show inward transport even in disks characterized by solid body rotation, which are quite far from axisymmetric. If the kinetic energy of rotational velocity fluctuations increases with time because of coupling with the mean flow (as in an instability), the relationship suggests (and our simulations confirm) that in a Keplerian disk the Reynolds stress is negative, i.e., that the angular momentum and energy transport is inward. The analogous relationship for shearing but nonrotating (Cartesian) flow displays the opposite sign for the fluctuation tensor, i.e., an increase in the "streamwise" velocity fluctuations is associated with outward (from higher momentum to smaller momentum) transport. Although Cartesian shear flows are known to be extremely sensitive to disruption by nonlinear secondary instabilities, hydrodynamical calculations presented here demonstrate that Keplerian disk flows show no such inclination. We suggest that the key to understanding this critical difference is the very different nature of the interaction between the mean flow and the transport in each system. We provide a physical interpretation of our findings in terms of the role epicyclic oscillations play in mediating angular momentum transport. We base our convection simulations upon a reproducible analytic expression for the vertical profile of an unstable equilibrium state in a stratified disk. The nonlinear evolution of the convective cells is then followed after the initial profile is perturbed. Convection can be sustained only if an ad hoc source of heating is added to the disk midplane. The net transport associated with steady convection is small and on average inward. A comparison between the volume-averaged Reynolds stress and the time rate of change of the azimuthal kinetic energy associated with fluctuations in the rotational velocity shows remarkable agreement with our simple analytic predictions. Taken as a whole, these results offer little hope that convection or any other form of incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence is likely to be a significant source of angular momentum transport in nonmagnetic disks. Coherent pressure forcing by, e.g., spiral density waves, remains a viable option.},

abstract = {Because the magnetorotational instability is capable of exponentially amplifying weak pre-existing magnetic fields, it might be hoped that the character of the magnetic field in accretion disks would be independent of the nature of the seed field. However, the divergence-free nature of magnetic fields in highly conducting fluids ensures that their large-scale topology is preserved, no matter how greatly the field intensity is changed. By performing global two- and three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic disk simulations with several different topologies for the initial magnetic field, we explore the degree to which the character of the flows around black holes depends on the initial topology. We find that while the qualitative properties of the accretion flow are nearly independent of field topology, jet launching is very sensitive to it; a sense of vertical field consistent for at least an inner disk inflow time is essential to the support of strong jets.},

title = {Models of Jupiter's Growth Incorporating Thermal and Hydrodynamic  Constraints},
abstract = { [Abridged] We model the growth of Jupiter via core nucleated accretion, applying constraints from hydrodynamical processes that result from the disk-planet interaction. We compute the planet's internal structure using a Henyey-type stellar evolution code. The planet's interactions with the protoplanetary disk are calculated using 3-D hydrodynamic simulations. Previous models of Jupiter's growth have taken the radius of the planet to be approximately one Hill sphere radius, Rhill. However, 3-D hydrodynamic simulations show that only gas within 0.25Rhill remains bound to the planet, with the more distant gas eventually participating in the shear flow of the protoplanetary disk. Therefore in our new simulations, the planet's outer boundary is placed at the location where gas has the thermal energy to reach the portion of the flow not bound to the planet. We find that the smaller radius increases the time required for planetary growth by ~5%. Thermal pressure limits the rate at which a planet less than a few dozen times as massive as Earth can accumulate gas from the protoplanetary disk, whereas hydrodynamics regulates the growth rate for more massive planets. Within a moderately viscous disk, the accretion rate peaks when the planet's mass is about equal to the mass of Saturn. In a less viscous disk hydrodynamical limits to accretion are smaller, and the accretion rate peaks at lower mass. To account for disk dissipation, we perform some of our simulations of Jupiter's growth within a disk whose surface gas density decreases on a timescale of 3Myr. According to our simulations, proto-Jupiter's distended and thermally-supported envelope was too small to capture the planet's current retinue of irregular satellites as advocated by Pollack et al. (1979). },

title = {On the Stability of Elliptical Vortices in Accretion Discs},
abstract = { (Abriged) The existence of large-scale and long-lived 2D vortices in accretion discs has been debated for more than a decade. They appear spontaneously in several 2D disc simulations and they are known to accelerate planetesimal formation through a dust trapping process. However, the issue of the stability of these structures to the imposition of 3D disturbances is still not fully understood, and it casts doubts on their long term survival.  Aim: We present new results on the 3D stability of elliptical vortices embedded in accretion discs, based on a linear analysis and several non-linear simulations.  Methods: We derive the linearised equations governing the 3D perturbations in the core of an elliptical vortex, and we show that they can be reduced to a Floquet problem. We solve this problem numerically in the astrophysical regime and we present several analytical limits for which the mechanism responsible for the instability can be explained. Finally, we compare the results of the linear analysis to some high resolution simulations.  Results: We show that most anticyclonic vortices are unstable due to a resonance between the turnover time and the local epicyclic oscillation period. In addition, we demonstrate that a strong vertical stratification does not create any additional stable domain of aspect ratio, but it significantly reduces growth rates for relatively weak (and therefore elongated) vortices.  Conclusions: Elliptical vortices are always unstable, whatever the horizontal or vertical aspect-ratio is. The instability can however be weak and is often found at small scales, making it difficult to detect in low-order finite-difference simulations. },

title = {Self-Similar Solution of Hot Accretion Flows with Ordered Magnetic Field  and Outflow},
abstract = { Observations and numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations indicate the existence of outflows and ordered large-scale magnetic fields in the inner region of hot accretion flows. In this paper we present the self-similar solutions for advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) with outflows and ordered magnetic fields. Stimulated by numerical simulations, we assume that the magnetic field has a strong toroidal component and a vertical component in addition to a stochastic component. We obtain the self-similar solutions to the equations describing the magnetized ADAFs, taking into account the dynamical effects of the outflow. We compare the results with the canonical ADAFs and find that the dynamical properties of ADAFs such as radial velocity, angular velocity and temperature can be significantly changed in the presence of ordered magnetic fields and outflows. The stronger the magnetic field is, the lower the temperature of the accretion flow will be, and the faster the flow rotates. The relevance to observations is briefly discussed. },

abstract = {Aims. We study the changes in the properties of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability in a shearing box, as the computational domain size in the radial direction is varied relative to the height. Methods: We perform 3D simulations in the shearing box approximation, with a net magnetic flux, and we consider computational domains with different aspect ratios. Results: We find that in boxes of aspect ratio unity the transport of angular momentum is strongly intermittent and dominated by channel solutions in agreement with previous work. In contrast, in boxes with larger aspect ratios, the channel solutions and the associated intermittent behavior disappear. Conclusions: There is strong evidence that, as the aspect ratio becomes larger, the characteristics of the solution become aspect ratio independent. We conclude that shearing box calculations with an aspect ratio of unity or near unity may introduce spurious effects.},

title = {Local Three-dimensional Simulations of an Accretion Disk Hydromagnetic Dynamo},
abstract = {Using three-dimensional numerical simulations, we have found that the weak-field magnetorotational instability constitutes a hydromagnetic dynamo in astrophysical disks. The field amplification mechanism lies outside the scope of kinematic dynamo theory and implies that kinematic dynamo theory is not applicable to accretion disk systems. We begin with simulations of isotropic, homogeneous turbulence to demonstrate the ability of our finite-difference code to reproduce known dynamos. To calibrate our code, we measure magnetic field rates when the turbulent velocity field is not sustained through external forcing. When the turbulence is maintained with imposed velocity fields, a magnetic dynamo can be produced. Two cases are considered: velocity fields with and without net helicity. Both the helical and the nonhelical velocity fields amplify and sustain magnetic fields despite substantial turbulent dissipation. The nonhelical dynamo increases the magnetic field energy by an order of magnitude. The helical dynamo produces greater amplification (a factor of 30 in energy) and a more ordered field. Lorentz forces eventually limit the growth of the magnetic field in both cases. We next carry out simulations in the local shearing box model of an accretion disk. The initial magnetic field has a mean field value of zero over the computational domain and is weak in the sense that the initial AlIven speed is much less than the sound speed. The magnetorotational instability rapidly generates turbulence within the disk. The turbulence is anisotropic, producing significant Maxwell and Reynolds stresses that transport angular momentum outward. Both the stresses and magnetic energy density remain subthermal and do not approach equipartition. The magnetic energy is amplified by a factor of 20 and maintained for over 200 orbits of time, far longer than the magnetic decay time in the absence of an amplification mechanism. A parameter survey indicates the final turbulent state does not depend on the initial average field strength; some dependence on the computational domain size, magnetic Prandtl number, and numerical resolution is observed. Finally, we demonstrate explicitly that more than shear and turbulence are required to produce dynamo amplification of magnetic fields.

title = {Magnetic Field Diffusion in Self-consistently Turbulent Accretion Disks},
abstract = {We show how the level of turbulence in accretion disks can be derived from a self-consistency requirement that the associated effective viscosity should match the instantaneous accretion rate. This method is applicable when turbulence has a direct energy cascade. Only limited information on the origin and properties of the turbulence, such as its injection scale and anisotropy, is needed. The method is illustrated by considering the case of turbulence originating from the magnetic shearing instability. The corresponding effective kinematic viscosity coefficient is shown to scale as the 1/3 power of surface mass density at a given radius in optically thick disks, and to be describable by a Shakura-Sunyaev law with α≍0.04. Mass flow in disks fed at a localized hot spot is calculated for accretion regimes driven by such turbulence, as well as passive magnetic field diffusion and dragging. An important result of this analysis is that thin disks supported by turbulence driven by the magnetic shearing instability, and more generally any turbulence with injection scale of order of the disk thickness, are very low magnetic Reynolds number systems. Turbulent viscosity-driven solutions with negligible field dragging and no emission of cold winds or jets are natural consequences of such regimes. Disks of accreting objects that are magnetized enough to be shielded by a magnetopause, however, may not operate in their innermost regions in the magnetic shearing instability regime. The possibility therefore remains to be explored of centrifugally driven winds emanating from such regions.},

title = {Magnetorotational Instability in Protoplanetary Disks. I. On the Global Stability of Weakly Ionized Disks with Ohmic Dissipation},
abstract = {We investigate the stability of uniformly magnetized accretion disks, including the effect of ohmic dissipation. The growth of axisymmetric local and global modes is examined using linear perturbation theory. A simple local analysis shows that the dissipation process generally suppresses the growth of magnetorotational instability when the magnetic Reynolds number is less than unity. The characteristic length scale of unstable modes becomes longer than that of the ideal MHD case, and its unstable growth rate is inversely proportional to the magnetic diffusivity. We perform a global linear analysis in which the vertical structure of the disk is considered. The growth rate of the magnetorotational instability is obtained by solving eigen equations numerically. We find that the conditions for existing unstable global modes are beta_c>~1 and beta_cR_mc>~1, where beta_c and R_mc are the plasma beta value and the magnetic Reynolds number defined at the midplane of the disk. The global stability criteria are approximately given by whether the minimum unstable wavelength expected by the local analysis would be shorter than the scale height of the disk or not. We also find unstable modes whose eigenfunctions of the perturbed velocities have amplitude localized near the surface layer of the disk. These unstable modes indicate layered accretion in the nonlinear regime. We apply the results of linear analysis to protoplanetary disks. For the case of the minimum-mass solar nebula, the magnetorotational instability occurs at the region farther out than 15 AU. This result suggests nonsteady accretion onto a central star in protoplanetary disks.},

title = {Viscous, Resistive Magnetorotational Modes},
abstract = {We carry out a comprehensive analysis of the behavior of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in viscous, resistive plasmas. We find exact, nonlinear solutions of the nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations describing the local dynamics of an incompressible, differentially rotating background threaded by a vertical magnetic field when disturbances with wavenumbers perpendicular to the shear are considered. We provide a geometrical description of these viscous, resistive MRI modes and show how their physical structure is modified as a function of the Reynolds and magnetic Reynolds numbers. We demonstrate that when finite dissipative effects are considered, velocity and magnetic field disturbances are no longer orthogonal (as is the case in the ideal MHD limit) unless the magnetic Prandtl number is unity. We generalize previous results found in the ideal limit and show that a series of key properties of the mean Reynolds and Maxwell stresses also hold for the viscous, resistive MRI. In particular, we show that the Reynolds stress is always positive and the Maxwell stress is always negative. Therefore, even in the presence of viscosity and resistivity, the total mean angular momentum transport is always directed outward. We also find that, for any combination of the Reynolds and magnetic Reynolds numbers, magnetic disturbances dominate both the energetics and the transport of angular momentum and that the total mean energy density is an upper bound for the total mean stress responsible for angular momentum transport. The ratios between the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses and between magnetic and kinetic energy densities increase with decreasing Reynolds numbers for any magnetic Reynolds number; the lowest limit of both ratios is reached in the ideal MHD regime. The analytical results presented here provide new benchmarks for the various algorithms employed to solve the viscous, resistive MHD equations in the shearing box approximation.},

title = {Where is the radiation edge in magnetized black hole accretion discs?},
abstract = {General relativistic (GR) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of black hole accretion find significant magnetic stresses near and inside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), suggesting that such flows could radiate in a manner noticeably different from the prediction of the standard model, which assumes that there are no stresses in that region. We provide estimates of how phenomenologically interesting parameters like the `radiation edge', the innermost ring of the disc from which substantial thermal radiation escapes to infinity, may be altered by stresses near the ISCO. These estimates are based on data from a large number of three-dimensional GRMHD simulations combined with GR ray tracing. For slowly spinning black holes (a/M < 0.9), the radiation edge lies well inside where the standard model predicts, particularly when the system is viewed at high inclination. For more rapidly spinning black holes, the contrast is smaller. At fixed total luminosity, the characteristic temperature of the accretion flow increases between a factor of 1.2 and 2.4 over that predicted by the standard model, whilst at fixed mass accretion rate, there is a corresponding enhancement of the accretion luminosity which may be anywhere from tens of per cent to order unity. When all these considerations are combined, we find that, for fixed black hole mass, luminosity and inclination angle, our uncertainty in the characteristic temperature of the radiation reaching distant observers due to uncertainty in dissipation profile (around a factor of 3) is greater than the uncertainty due to a complete lack of knowledge of the black hole's spin (around a factor of 2) and furthermore that spin estimates based on the stress-free inner boundary condition provide an upper limit to a/M.},

The stability of the explicit time integration is ensured by including the whistler wave speed for the shortest discrete wave length into the numerical dissipation, but then second order accuracy requires the use of symmetric limiters in the total variation diminishing scheme. The implicit scheme employs a Newton Krylov Schwarz type approach, and can achieve significantly better efficiency than the explicit scheme with an appropriate preconditioner.

These solutions are advection dominated, so that most of the viscously dissipated energy is advected radially with the flow. We model the accreting gas as a two-temperature plasma and include cooling by bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and Comptonization. We obtain electron temperatures Te 108.5-1010 K. The new solutions are present only for mass accretion rates M{\.s}crit less than a critical rate A crit which we calculate as a function of radius R and viscosity parameter α. For M{\.s} < M{\.s}crit we show that there are three equilibrium branches of solutions. One of the branches corresponds to a cool optically thick flow which is the well-known thin disk solution of Shakura {\&} Sunyaev Another branch corresponds to a hot optically thin flow, discovered originally by Shapiro, Lightman, {\&} Eardley (SLE). This solution is thermally unstable. The third branch corresponds to our new advection-dominated solution. This solution is hotter and more optically thin than the SLE solution but is viscously and thermally stable. It is related to the ion torus model of Rees et al. and may potentially explain the hard X-ray and γ-ray emission from X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. For M{\.s} < M{\.s}crit, our work suggests that an accretion flow can choose between two distinct states, namely, the thin disk solution and the new advection-dominated solution, both of which are apparently stable. We argue that, in certain circumstances, it is only the latter solution that is truly stable, and that a thin disk will spontaneously evaporate and convert itself into an advection-dominated flow. Even for M{\.s}crit we suggest that a thin disk may evaporate partially so that a fraction of the accretion occurs via an advection-dominated hot corona. If these ideas are correct, then optically thin advection-dominated flows must be very widespread, possibly the most common form of sub-Eddington accretion in black holes. Our calculations indicate that advection-dominated accretion on black holes differs considerably from similar flows around neutron stars. The crucial physical difference, which has been mentioned previously in the literature, is that in the former the advected energy is lost into the hole, whereas in the latter it is thermalized and re-radiated at the stellar surface, thereby providing soft photons which can Compton-cool the accreting gas. We obtain M{\.s}crit ∼ α2M{\.s}Edd for accreting black holes, independent of the black hole mass, whereas it is ∼0.1α2M{\.s}Edd for neutron stars. Advection-dominated accretion is therefore more likely to occur in accreting black holes, and these systems will be underluminous for their M{\.s} because the bulk of the energy is advected into the hole rather than being radiated. We find that Te in accreting black hole flows rises up to ∼109 1010 K, compared to Te ∼ 108.5-109 K in neutron star systems. Spectra of accreting black holes are therefore expected to be harder than those of accreting neutron stars. Pair effects are also more likely in black hole systems, though only at higher A than those we consider.},

title = {Saturation and Thermalization of the Magnetorotational Instability: Recurrent Channel Flows and Reconnections},
abstract = {The nonlinear evolution and saturation mechanism of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) are investigated using three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations. A local shearing box is used for our numerical analysis, and the simulations begin with a purely vertical magnetic field. We find that the magnetic stress in the nonlinear stage of the MRI is strongly fluctuating. The time evolution shows the quasi-periodic recurrence of spike-shaped variations, typically for a few orbits, which correspond to the rapid amplification of the magnetic field by the nonlinear growth of a two-channel solution followed by decay through magnetic reconnections. The increase rate of the total energy in the shearing box system is analytically related to the volume-averaged torque in the system. We find that at the saturated state this energy gain of the system is balanced with the increase of thermal energy, mostly due to joule heating. The spike-shaped time evolution is a general feature of the nonlinear evolution of the MRI in disks threaded by vertical fields and can be seen if the effective magnetic Reynolds number is larger than about unity.},

title = {Angular momentum transport in protostellar discs},
abstract = {Angular momentum transport in protostellar discs can take place either radially, through turbulence induced by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), or vertically, through the torque exerted by a large-scale magnetic field that threads the disc. Using semi-analytic and numerical results, we construct a model of steady-state discs that includes vertical transport by a centrifugally driven wind as well as MRI-induced turbulence. We present approximate criteria for the occurrence of either one of these mechanisms in an ambipolar diffusion-dominated disc. We derive `strong field' solutions in which the angular momentum transport is purely vertical and `weak field' solutions that are the stratified-disc analogues of the previously studied MRI channel modes; the latter are transformed into accretion solutions with predominantly radial angular momentum transport when we implement a turbulent-stress prescription based on published results of numerical simulations. We also analyse `intermediate field strength' solutions in which both modes of transport operate at the same radial location; we conclude, however, that significant spatial overlap of these two mechanisms is unlikely to occur in practice. To further advance this study, we have developed a general scheme that incorporates also the Hall and Ohm conductivity regimes in discs with a realistic ionization structure.},

title = {Energetics in MRI driven Turbulence},
abstract = {In these proceedings we present recent efforts to understand the energetics of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). These studies are carried out in the local (shearing box) approximation using the Athena simulation code. Athena is a higher order Godunov algorithm based on the piecewise parabolic method (PPM), the corner transport upwind (CTU) integration algorithm, and the constrained transport (CT) algorithm for evolving the magnetic field. This algorithm is particularly suited for these studies owing to the conservation properties of a Godunov scheme and the particular implementation of the shearing box source terms used here. We present a variety of calculations which may be compared directly to previously published results and discuss them in some detail. The only significant discrepancy found between the results presented here and in the published literature involves the turbulent heating rate. We observe the presence of recurrent channel solutions in calculations involving a mean vertical magnetic field and the associated time lag between the energy injection and thermalization rate. We also present the results of a shearing box calculation which includes an optically thin radiative term with a cooling rate selected to match the turbulent heating rate. Some properties which we find uniformly present in all of the calculations presented here are compressible fluctuations, spiral waves and weak shocks. It is found that these compressible modes dominate the temporal fluctuations in the probability distribution functions for most of the thermodynamic variables; only the specific entropy is relatively immune to their effects.},

In the first part of this work, a linear analysis is presented of the instability, which is local and extremely powerful; the maximum growth rate, which is of the order of the angular rotation velocity, is independent of the strength of the magnetic field. Fluid motions associated with the instability directly generate both poloidal and toroidal field components. In the second part of this investigation, the scaling relation between the instability's wavenumber and the Alfven velocity is demonstrated, and the independence of the maximum growth rate from magnetic field strength is confirmed.},

abstract = { Protoplanet eccentricities of e >~ H/r can slow or reverse migration, but previous 2D studies have shown that gravitational scattering cannot maintain significant planet eccentricities against disc-induced damping. We simulate the evolution of low-mass protoplanetary swarms in three dimensions. The aim is to examine both protoplanet survival rates and the dynamical structure of the resulting planetary systems, and to compare them with 2D simulations. We present results from a 3D hydrodynamic simulation of eight protoplanets embedded in a protoplanetary disc. We also present a suite of simulations performed using an N-body code, modified to include prescriptions for planetary migration and for eccentricity and inclination damping. These prescriptions were obtained by fitting analytic formulae to hydrodynamic simulations of planets embedded in discs with initially eccentric and/or inclined orbits. As was found in two dimensions, differential migration produces groups of protoplanets in stable, multiple mean-motion resonances that migrate in lockstep, preventing prolonged periods of gravitational scattering. In almost all simulations, this leads to large-scale migration of the protoplanet swarm into the central star in the absence of a viable stopping mechanism. The evolution involves mutual collisions, occasional instances of large-scale scattering, and the frequent formation of the long-lived, co-orbital planet systems that arise in > 30% of all runs. Disc-induced damping overwhelms eccentricity and inclination growth due to planet-planet interactions. Co-orbital planets are a natural outcome of dynamical relaxation in a strongly dissipative environment, and if observed in nature would imply that such a period of evolution commonly arises during planetary formation. },

The main process in the hard state appears to be scattering of blackbody photons from a cold disk by thermal electrons in a hot inner flow, and any contribution from nonthermal synchrotron emission is at most small. In the soft states, blackbody disk emission dominates energetically, and its high-energy tail is due to scattering by hybrid, thermal/nonthermal electrons, probably in active regions above the disk surface. State transitions appear to correspond to a variable inner radius of the cold disk driven by changes of the accretion rate. The existence of two accretion solutions, hot and cold, in a range of the accretion rate leads to hysteresis in low-mass X-ray binaries.},

However, vortex dynamics is commonly studied in non-self-gravitating disks. The main goal here is to examine the effects of disk self-gravity on the vortex dynamics via numerical simulations. In the self-gravitating case, when quasi-steady gravitoturbulent state is reached, vortices appear as transient structures undergoing recurring phases of formation, growth to sizes comparable to a local Jeans scale, and eventual shearing and destruction due to gravitational instability. Each phase lasts over 2-3 orbital periods. Vortices and density waves appear to be coupled implying that, in general, one should consider both vortex and density wave modes for a proper understanding of self-gravitating disk dynamics. Our results imply that given such an irregular and rapidly changing, transient character of vortex evolution in self-gravitating disks it may be difficult for such vortices to effectively trap dust particles in their centers that is a necessary process towards planet formation. },

title = {Thermal Instability in Shearing and Periodic Turbulence},
abstract = {The thermal instability with a piecewise power law cooling function is investigated using one- and three-dimensional simulations with periodic and shearing-periodic boundary conditions in the presence of constant thermal diffusion and kinematic viscosity coefficients. Consistent with earlier findings, the flow behavior depends on the average density, <ρ>. When <ρ> is in the range (1-5)×10-24 g cm-3, the system is unstable and segregates into cool and warm phases with temperatures of roughly 100 and 104 K, respectively. However, in all cases the resulting average pressure <p> is independent of <ρ> and just a little above the minimum value. For a constant heating rate of 0.015 ergs g-1 s-1, the mean pressure is around 24×10-14 dyn (corresponding to p/kB~1750 K cm-3). Cool patches tend to coalesce into bigger ones. In all cases investigated, there is no sustained turbulence, which is in agreement with earlier results. Simulations in which turbulence is driven by a body force show that when rms velocities of between 10 and 30 km s-1 are obtained, the resulting dissipation rates are comparable to the thermal energy input rate. The resulting mean pressures are then about 30×10-14 dyn, corresponding to p/kB~2170 K cm-3. This is comparable to the value expected for the Galaxy. Differential rotation tends to make the flow two-dimensional, that is, uniform in the streamwise direction, but this does not lead to instability.},

The disk contains a dead zone in all scenarios except those with small dust grains removed and a fraction of the short-lived radionuclides remaining in the gas. All the cases without exception have an "undead zone" where intermediate resistivities prevent magneto-rotational turbulence while allowing shear-generated large-scale magnetic fields. The mass column in the undead zone is typically greater than the column in the turbulent surface layers. The results support the idea that the dead and undead zones are robust consequences of cold, dusty gas with mass columns exceeding 1000 g/cm^2. },

title = {The Formation and Structure of a Strongly Magnetized Corona above a Weakly Magnetized Accretion Disk},
abstract = {We use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynmic (MHD) simulations to study the formation of a corona above an initially weakly magnetized, isothermal accretion disk. The simulations are local in the plane of the disk but extend up to 5 vertical scale heights above and below it. We describe a modification to time-explicit numerical algorithms for MHD that enables us to evolve such highly stratified disks for many orbital times. We find that for an initially toroidal field or a poloidal fields with a vanishing mean MHD turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) produces strong amplification of weak fields within 2 scale heights of the disk midplane in a few orbital times. Although the primary saturation mechanism of the MRI is local dissipation, about 25% of the magnetic energy generated by the MRI within 2 scale heights escapes because of buoyancy, producing a strongly magnetized corona above the disk. Most of the buoyantly rising magnetic energy is dissipated between 3 and 5 scale heights, suggesting that the corona will also be hot. Strong shocks with Mach numbers >~2 are continuously produced in the corona in response to mass motions deeper in the disk. Only a very weak mass outflow is produced through the outer boundary at 5 scale heights, although this is probably a reflection of our use of the local approximation in the plane of the disk. On long timescales the average vertical disk structure consists of a weakly magnetized (β~50) turbulent core below 2 scale heights and a strongly magnetized (β<~10-1) corona that is stable to the MRI above. The large-scale field structure in both the disk and the coronal regions is predominately toroidal. Equating the volume averaged heating rate to optically thin cooling curves, we estimate the temperature in the corona will be of order 104 K for protostellar disks and 108 K for disks around neutron stars. The functional form of the stress with vertical height is best described as flat within +/-2Hz but proportional to the density above +/-2Hz. For initially weak uniform vertical fields, we find the exponential growth of magnetic field via axisymmetric vertical modes of the MRI produces strongly buoyant sheets of magnetic energy that break the disk apart into horizontal channels. These channels rise several scale heights vertically before the onset of the Parker instability distorts the sheets and allows matter to flow back toward the midplane and reform a disk. Thereafter the entire disk is magnetically dominated and not well modeled by the local approximation. We suggest that this evolution may be relevant to the dynamical processes that disrupt the inner regions of a disk when it interacts with a strongly magnetized central object.},

title = {The numerical simulation of two-dimensional fluid flow with strong shocks},
abstract = {Many numerical schemes have been devised for the simulation of compressible gas dynamics on digital computers. One major difficulty regarding such a simulation is related to the representation of the shock and contact discontinuities which arise in these simulations. Von Neumann and Richtmyer (1950) have proposed a solution to this problem which with minor modifications is still in general use today. However, von Neumann and Richtmyer's approach has certain disadvantages which have led to continued efforts to obtain more convenient, more accurate, and/or more elegant solutions. The present investigation is concerned with three different approaches to the representation of discontinuities, taking into account artificial viscosity, linear hybridization, and a procedure suggested by Godunov (1959). Advantages and disadvantages of the three approaches are evaluated, and three test problems are discussed. Attention is also given to representative numerical methods, and the computed results of the test problems.},

abstract = {The effect of the Hall term on the evolution of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in weakly ionized accretion disks is investigated using local axisymmetric simulations. First, we show that the Hall term has important effects on the MRI when the temperature and density in the disk is below a few thousand K and between 1013 and 1018 cm-3, respectively. Such conditions can occur in the quiescent phase of dwarf nova disks, or in the inner part (inside 10-100 AU) of protoplanetary disks. When the Hall term is important, the properties of the MRI are dependent on the direction of the magnetic field with respect to the angular velocity vector Ω. If the disk is threaded by a uniform vertical field oriented in the same sense as Ω, the axisymmetric evolution of the MRI is an exponentially growing two-channel flow without saturation. When the field is oppositely directed to Ω, however, small scale fluctuations prevent the nonlinear growth of the channel flow and the MRI evolves into MHD turbulence. These results are anticipated from the characteristics of the linear dispersion relation. In axisymmetry on a field with zero-net flux, the evolution of the MRI is independent of the size of the Hall term relative to the inductive term. The evolution in this case is determined mostly by the effect of ohmic dissipation.},

A general study of the normal mode eigenvalue problem and the explicit analytic solution of a pair of particular limiting cases are presented. The fastest growing eigenmodes by numerical integration of the full linearized equations for more general cases are derived. The overall result is that the tori are unstable to low order non-axisymmetric modes and that the modes grow on a dynamical time-scale.

abstract = {The nonlinear saturation of the magnetorotational instability due to ohmic dissipation is investigated with two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks. We adopt a local disk model in which the physical quantities are assumed to be spatially uniform except for the shear velocity in the azimuthal direction. Starting with a weak vertical field, the magnetorotational instability is saturated in the nonlinear regime when the magnetic Reynolds number R_m is less than unity. In the saturated turbulent state, the growth of the magnetic field for the instability and the damping by the ohmic dissipation are almost balanced. The efficiency of angular momentum transport alpha is of the order of 10^-2 to 10^-3, and alpha is found to be inversely proportional to the initial beta value. When R_m>~1, channel solutions appear and the magnetic energy continues growing even with the dissipation process. We can roughly explain these features with the help of the results obtained by the linear analysis. Our conclusion is that the magnetic dissipation is one of the most important processes that determine the saturation level of the magnetorotational instability.},

Depending on the thickness of the disc and the efficiency of dissipative processes, these global deformations may be able to propagate into the innermost part of the disc in the form of stationary bending or density waves.

title = {Three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamical Simulations of Vertically Stratified Accretion Disks},
abstract = {We present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability (Balbus {\&} Hawley 1991) in an initially isothermal, vertically stratified accretion disk. The simulations are local in the plane of the disk, but are global in the vertical direction in the sense that the computational domain encompasses several scale heights. We find that the instability generates and maintains magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in stratified disks. The properties of the saturated, turbulent state are similar to those reported for nonstratified homogeneous boxes, e.g., the power-law spectral distribution is consistent with Kolmogorov. The angular momentum transport rate is proportional to the magnetic pressure; if the average rate is scaled to the equatorial pressure, as in a standard "α-disk" model, the constant of proportionality is α ≲ 0.01 for most of our simulations. This value may be limited somewhat by the numerical resolution of our simulations. We find buoyancy does not play an important role as a saturation mechanism. The nonlinear evolution of disks that begin with a variety of initial magnetic field geometries and strengths is similar. In particular, models in which the most unstable wavelengths are initially well resolved saturate at and maintain roughly the same magnetic energy density, suggesting dynamo action in the disk. We use the simulations to study the effect of the instability on the vertical structure of magnetic accretion disks. After saturation, the disk consists of a weakly magnetized core surrounded by a strongly magnetized corona. Changing the vertical boundary conditions does not significantly alter this structure. The vertical flux of magnetic energy is small compared to the local magnetic energy generation and dissipation rates. The disk is stable to Parker and buoyancy modes. Models evolved with an adiabatic equation of state undergo substantial heating due to nonlinear dissipation, resulting in an increase in the scale height of the disk. The vertical structure produced by the instability, particularly the presence of a strongly magnetized corona, may have relevance to the production of MHD winds from disks.},

The radial density profiles of the circumplanetary discs may be described by power-laws between r^-2 and r^-3/2. We find no evidence for the ring-like density enhancements that have been found in some previous models of circumplanetary discs. Temperature profiles follow a ~r^-7/10 power-law regardless of protoplanet mass or nebula grain opacity. The discs invariably have large scaleheights (H/r > 0.2), making them thick in comparison with their encompassing circumstellar discs, and they show no flaring. },

The algorithm is based on a previous work in which the MUSCL-Hancock scheme was used to evolve the induction equation. In this paper, we detail the extension of this scheme to the full MHD equations and discuss its properties. Results: . Through a series of test problems, we illustrate the performances of this new code using two different MHD Riemann solvers (Lax-Friedrich and Roe) and the need of the Adaptive Mesh Refinement capabilities in some cases. Finally, we show its versatility by applying it to two completely different astrophysical situations well studied in the past years: the growth of the magnetorotational instability in the shearing box and the collapse of magnetized cloud cores. Conclusions: . We have implemented a new Godunov scheme to solve the ideal MHD equations in the AMR code RAMSES. We have shown that it results in a powerful tool that can be applied to a great variety of astrophysical problems, ranging from galaxies formation in the early universe to high resolution studies of molecular cloud collapse in our galaxy.},

title = {Turbulent resistivity evaluation in MRI generated turbulence},
abstract = { (abriged) MRI turbulence is a leading mechanism for the generation of an efficient turbulent transport of angular momentum in an accretion disk through a turbulent viscosity effect. It is believed that the same process could also transport large-scale magnetic fields in disks, reshaping the magnetic structures in these objects. This process, known as turbulent resistivity, has been suggested and used in several accretion-ejection models and simulations to produce jets. Still, the efficiency of MRI-driven turbulence to transport large-scale magnetic fields is largely unknown.  We investigate this problem both analytically and numerically. We introduce a linear calculation of the MRI in the presence of a spatially inhomogeneous mean magnetic field. We show that, in this configuration, MRI modes lead to an efficient magnetic field transport, on the order of the angular momentum transport. We next use fully non linear simulations of MRI turbulence to compute the turbulent resistivity in several magnetic configurations.  We find that the turbulent resistivity is on the order of the turbulent viscosity in all our simulations, although somewhat lower. The turbulent resistivity tensor is found to be highly anisotropic with a diffusion coefficient 3 times greater in the radial direction than in the vertical direction.  These results support the possibility of driving jets from turbulent disks; the resulting jets may not be steady. },

title = {The effects of Prandtl number on black hole accretion flows},
abstract = {Recent numerical simulations of MHD turbulence, under very different driving conditions, and by several different investigators, all indicate a sensitivity of the rms fluctuations to the ratio of the microscopic viscosity to resistivity. This dimensionless quantity is known as the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. In general, standard astrophysical accretion disks are characterized by Pm ≪ 1 throughout their radial extent, while low luminosity accretors (e.g. Sag A∗) have Pm ≫ 1. Here, we show that standard α models of black hole accretion disks have a transition radius, measured in tens of Schwarzschild radii, at which the flow goes from Pm ≪ 1 to Pm ≫ 1. Moreover, this transition may well be dynamically unstable, leading to a sort of two-phase ``Prandtl number medium'' We advance the idea that this is the physical reason underlying the change in the accretion properties of the inner regions of Keplerian disks, leading to a truncation of the cool disk (Pm ≪ 1) and the onset of hot, low density gas flow (Pm ≫ 1).},

title = {Limitations of Hall MHD as a model for turbulence in weakly collisional  plasmas},
abstract = { The limitations of Hall MHD as a model for turbulence in weakly collisional plasmas are explored using quantitative comparisons to Vlasov-Maxwell kinetic theory over a wide range of parameter space. The validity of Hall MHD in the cold ion limit is shown, but spurious undamped wave modes exist in Hall MHD when the ion temperature is finite. It is argued that turbulence in the dissipation range of the solar wind must be one, or a mixture, of three electromagnetic wave modes: the parallel whistler, oblique whistler, or kinetic Alfven waves. These modes are generally well described by Hall MHD. Determining the applicability of linear kinetic damping rates in turbulent plasmas requires a suite of fluid and kinetic nonlinear numerical simulations. Contrasting fluid and kinetic simulations will also shed light on whether the presence of spurious wave modes alters the nonlinear couplings inherent in turbulence and will illuminate the turbulent dynamics and energy transfer in the regime of the characteristic ion kinetic scales. },

title = {Axisymmetric Shearing Box Models of Magnetized Disks},
abstract = {The local model, or shearing box, has proven a useful model for studying the dynamics of astrophysical disks. Here we consider the evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in an axisymmetric local model in order to evaluate the limitations of global axisymmetric models. An exploration of the model parameter space shows the following: (1) The magnetic energy and α-decay approximately exponentially after an initial burst of turbulence. For our code, HAM, the decay time τ~Res, where Res/2 is the number of zones per scale height. (2) In the initial burst of turbulence the magnetic energy is amplified by a factor proportional to Res3/4λR, where λR is the radial scale of the initial field. This scaling applies only if the most unstable wavelength of the magnetorotational instability is resolved and the final field is subthermal. (3) The shearing box is a resonant cavity and in linear theory exhibits a discrete set of compressive modes. These modes are excited by the MHD turbulence and are visible as quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in temporal power spectra of fluid variables at low spatial resolution. At high resolution the QPOs are hidden by a noise continuum. (4) In axisymmetry disk turbulence is local. The correlation function of the turbulence is limited in radial extent, and the peak magnetic energy density is independent of the radial extent of the box LR for LR>2H. (5) Similar results are obtained for the HAM, ZEUS, and ATHENA codes; ATHENA has an effective resolution that is nearly double that of HAM and ZEUS. (6) Similar results are obtained for 2D and 3D runs at similar resolution, but only for particular choices of the initial field strength and radial scale of the initial magnetic field.},

title = {Trapping of Magnetic Flux by the Plunge Region of a Black Hole Accretion Disk},
abstract = {The existence of the radius of marginal stability means that accretion flows around black holes invariably undergo a transition from a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulent disklike flow to an inward-plunging flow. We argue that the plunging inflow can greatly enhance the trapping of large-scale magnetic fields on the black hole, and therefore may increase the importance of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) effect relative to previous estimates that ignore the plunge region. We support this hypothesis by constructing and analyzing a toy model of the dragging and trapping of a large-scale field by a black hole disk, revealing a strong dependence of this effect on the effective magnetic Prandtl number of the MHD turbulent disk. Furthermore, we show that the enhancement of the BZ effect depends on the geometric thickness of the accretion disk. This may be, at least in part, the physical underpinnings of the empirical relation between the inferred geometric thickness of a black hole disk and the presence of a radio jet.},

title = {Relativistic Accretion Disk Models of High-State Black Hole X-Ray Binary Spectra},
abstract = {We present calculations of non-LTE, relativistic accretion disk models applicable to the high/soft state of black hole X-ray binaries. We include the effects of thermal Comptonization and bound-free and free-free opacities of all abundant ion species. Taking into account the relativistic propagation of photons from the local disk surface to an observer at infinity, we present spectra calculated for a variety of accretion rates, black hole spin parameters, disk inclinations, and stress prescriptions. We also consider nonzero inner torques on the disk and explore different vertical dissipation profiles, including some that are motivated by recent radiation magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of magnetorotational turbulence. Bound-free metal opacity generally produces significantly less spectral hardening than previous models that only considered Compton scattering and free-free opacity. We find that the resulting effective photosphere usually lies at a small fraction of the total column depth, producing spectra that are remarkably independent of the stress prescription and vertical structure assumptions. We provide detailed comparisons between our models and the widely used multicolor disk model. Frequency-dependent discrepancies exist that may affect the parameters of other spectral components when this simpler disk model is used to fit modern X-ray data. For a given source, our models predict that the luminosity in the high/soft state should approximately scale with the fourth power of the empirically inferred maximum temperature, but with a slight hardening at high luminosities. This is in good agreement with observations.},

title = {Shell-to-shell energy transfer in magnetohydrodynamics. II. Kinematic dynamo},
abstract = {We study the transfer of energy between different scales for forced three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics turbulent flows in the kinematic dynamo regime. Two different forces are examined: a nonhelical Taylor-Green flow with magnetic Prandtl number PM =0.4 and a helical ABC flow with PM =1 . This analysis allows us to examine which scales of the velocity flow are responsible for dynamo action and identify which scales of the magnetic field receive energy directly from the velocity field and which scales receive magnetic energy through the cascade of the magnetic field from large to small scales. Our results show that the turbulent velocity fluctuations in the inertial range are responsible for the magnetic field amplification at small scales (small-scale dynamo) while the large-scale field is amplified mostly due to the large-scale flow. A direct cascade of the magnetic field energy from large to small scales is also presented and is a complementary mechanism for the increase of the magnetic field at small scales. The input of energy from the inertial range velocity field into the small magnetic scales dominates over the energy cascade up to the wave number where the magnetic energy spectrum peaks. At even smaller scales, most of the magnetic energy input is from the cascading process.},

title = {Instability, turbulence, and enhanced transport in accretion disks},
abstract = {Recent years have witnessed dramatic progress in our understanding of how turbulence arises and transports angular momentum in astrophysical accretion disks. The key conceptual point has its origins in work dating from the 1950s, but its implications have been fully understood only in the last several years: the combination of a subthermal magnetic field (any nonpathological configuration will do) and outwardly decreasing differential rotation rapidly generates magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence via a remarkably simple linear instability. The result is a greatly enhanced effective viscosity, the origin of which had been a long-standing problem. The MHD nature of disk turbulence has linked two broad domains of magnetized fluid research: accretion theory and dynamos. The understanding that weak magnetic fields are not merely passively acted upon by turbulence, but actively generate it, means that the assumptions of classical dynamo theory break down in disks. Paralleling the new conceptual understanding has been the development of powerful numerical MHD codes. These have taught us that disks truly are turbulent, transporting angular momentum at greatly enhanced rates. We have also learned, however, that not all forms of disk turbulence do this. Purely hydrodynamic turbulence, when it is imposed, simply causes fluctuations without a significant increase in transport. The interplay between numerical simulation and analytic arguments has been particularly fruitful in accretion disk theory and is a major focus of this article. The authors conclude with a summary of what is now known of disk turbulence and mention some knotty outstanding questions (e.g., what is the physics behind nonlinear field saturation?) for which we may soon begin to develop answers.},

abstract = {We study the properties of the turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability in a stratified shearing box with outflow boundary conditions and an equation of state determined by self-consistent dissipation and radiation losses. A series of simulations with increasing resolution are performed within a fixed computational box. We achieve numerical convergence with respect to radial and azimuthal resolution. As vertical resolution is improved, the ratio of stress to pressure increases slowly, but the absolute levels of both the stress and the pressure increase noticeably. These results are in contrast with those of previous work on unstratified shearing boxes, in which improved resolution caused a diminution in the magnetic field strength. We argue that the persistence of strong magnetic field at higher resolution found in the stratified case is due to buoyancy. In addition, we find that the time-averaged vertical correlation length of the magnetic field near the disk midplane is sime3 times larger than that found in previous unstratified simulations, decreasing slowly with improved vertical resolution. We further show that the undulatory Parker instability drives the magnetic field upwelling at several scale heights from the midplane that is characteristic of stratified magnetohydrodynamics-turbulent disks.},

title = {A mean-field approach to the propagation of field patterns in stratified magnetorotational turbulence},
abstract = {ABSTRACT Local shearing box simulations of stratified magnetorotational turbulence invariably exhibit cyclic field patterns which propagate away from the disc mid-plane. A common explanation for this is magnetic buoyancy. The recent analysis by Shi et al. however shows that the flow is buoyantly stable below one disc scaleheight H, necessitating an alternative explanation in this region. We here conduct and analyse direct numerical simulations to explain the observed behaviour by means of a mean-field description. Apart from the mean radial and azimuthal field, we monitor the small-scale current helicity, which we propose as a key indicator for saturation. Reconstructing the horizontally averaged field, we demonstrate that the problem can be reduced to a 1D induction equation. By means of the so-called test field method, we then determine the underlying closure parameters. Our analysis shows that, apart from a possible direct magnetorotational instability (MRI) dynamo, two distinct indirect dynamo mechanisms operate in the disc. This resolves the issue of the `wrong' sign of the MRI dynamo effect. Finally, we use the obtained closure parameters to run a dynamically quenched dynamo model. This model approximately recovers the observed field patterns in the mean fields. Moreover, the model reproduces the prevailing parity and the distinct phase pattern in the small-scale current helicity. The latter property might open a potential route to understand the saturation of MRI induced turbulence.},

title = {Dependence of Inner Accretion Disk Stress on Parameters: The Schwarzschild Case},
abstract = {We explore the parameter dependence of inner disk stress in black hole accretion by contrasting the results of a number of simulations, all employing three-dimensional general relativistic MHD in a Schwarzschild spacetime. Five of these simulations were performed with the intrinsically conservative code HARM3D, which allows careful regulation of the disk aspect ratio, H/R; our simulations span a range in H/R from 0.06 to 0.17. We contrast these simulations with two previously reported simulations in a Schwarzschild spacetime in order to investigate possible dependence of the inner disk stress on magnetic topology. In all cases, much care was devoted to technical issues: ensuring adequate resolution and azimuthal extent, and averaging only over those time periods when the accretion flow is in approximate inflow equilibrium. We find that the time-averaged radial dependence of fluid-frame electromagnetic stress is almost completely independent of both disk thickness and poloidal magnetic topology. It rises smoothly inward at all radii (exhibiting no feature associated with the innermost stable circular orbit, ISCO) until just outside the event horizon, where the stress plummets to zero. Reynolds stress can also be significant near the ISCO and in the plunging region; the magnitude of this stress, however, depends on both disk thickness and magnetic topology. The two stresses combine to make the net angular momentum accreted per unit rest mass 7%-15% less than the angular momentum of the ISCO.},

abstract = {We examine the effects of density stratification on magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability in local simulations that adopt the shearing box approximation. Our primary result is that, even in the absence of explicit dissipation, the addition of vertical gravity leads to convergence in the turbulent energy densities and stresses as the resolution increases, contrary to results for zero net flux, unstratified boxes. The ratio of total stress to midplane pressure has a mean of ~0.01, although there can be significant fluctuations on long (gsim50 orbits) timescales. We find that the time-averaged stresses are largely insensitive to both the radial and the vertical aspect ratios of our simulation domain. For simulations with explicit dissipation, we find that stratification extends the range of Reynolds and magnetic Prandtl numbers for which turbulence is sustained, but the behavior of such simulations on long timescales is highly variable. Confirming the results of previous studies, we find oscillations in the large-scale toroidal field with periods of ~10 orbits and describe the dynamo process that underlies these cycles. We discuss possible origins for the different convergence properties of the stratified and unstratified domains and identify open questions that remain to be answered.},

title = {Magnetized Accretion Flows: Effects of Gas Pressure},
abstract = { We study how axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) accretion flows depend on gamma adiabatic index in the polytropic equation of state. This work is an extension of Moscibrodzka {\&} Proga (2008), where we investigated the gamma dependence of 2-D Bondi-like accretion flows in the hydrodynamical (HD) limit. Our main goal is to study if simulations for various gamma can give us insights into to the problem of various modes of accretion observed in several types of accretion systems such as black hole binaries (BHB), active galactic nuclei (AGN), and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We find that for gamma >~ 4/3, the fast rotating flow forms a thick torus that is supported by rotation and gas pressure. As shown before for gamma=5/3, such a torus produces a strong, persistent bipolar outflow that can significantly reduce the polar funnel accretion of a slowly rotating flow. For low gamma, close to 1, the torus is thin and is supported by rotation. The thin torus produces an unsteady outflow which is too weak to propagate throughout the polar funnel inflow. Compared to their HD counterparts, the MHD simulations show that the magnetized torus can produce an outflow and does not exhibit regular oscillations. Generally, our simulations demonstrate how the torus thickness affects the outflow production. They also support the notion that the geometrical thickness of the torus correlates with the power of the torus outflow. Our results, applied to observations, suggest that the torus ability to radiatively cool and become thin can correspond to a suppression of a jet as observed in the BHB during a transition from a hard/low to soft/high spectral state and a transition from a quiescent to hard/low state in AGN. },

abstract = { A rigorous theory for the generation of a large-scale magnetic field by random nonhelically forced motions of a conducting fluid combined with a linear shear is presented in the analytically tractable limit of Rm << Re << 1. This is a minimal proof-of-concept calculation aiming to put the shear dynamo, a new effect recently reported in a number of numerical experiments, on a firm physical and analytical footing. Numerically observed scalings of the wavenumber and growth rate of the fastest growing mode, previously not understood, are derived analytically. The simplicity of the model suggests that shear dynamo may be a generic property of shear flows - with ubiquitous relevance to astrophysical systems. },

title = {Incorporation of ambipolar diffusion into the ZEUS magetohydrodynamics code},
abstract = {Magnetic fields tied to ions can diffuse through mostly neutral gas: this occurs in protostellar disks and in the cores of molecular clouds. We describe an algorithm that includes ambipolar diffusion in the astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics code ZEUS. We use the approximations that both electrons and ions have equal and constant temperature, that the ion inertia is negligible, and that the ion density is proportional to a power of the neutral density. Our algorithm is fully explicit, and treats the magnetic field using constrained transport and the method of characteristics. We test the algorithm by computing the gravitational collapse of a magnetically supported slab, and by comparing the computed solution for an oblique C-shock to a semi-analytic solution that we have derived. We then compute the developement of the magnetorotational instability described by Balbus and Hawley in a magnetized accretion disk, including the effects of ambipolar diffusion. Our computation agrees with the published linear analysis of how diffusion prevents instability, and it allows us to describe the nonlinear development of the instability when the diffusion is important but not dominant. We find that ambipolar diffusion indeed creates the sharp structures by Brandenburg and Zweibel.},

title = {Shear rate dependence and the effect of resistivity in magneto-rotationally unstable, stratified disks},
abstract = {We study the effect of resistivity and variation of shear rate, q=-dlog Omega /dR, on the magneto-rotational instability in stratified disks. Special attention is paid to dynamo alpha -action and transport properties of the flow. The 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations are performed in the local shearing-box approximation employing the code NIRVANA. Due to the chosen type of vertical boundary condition a mean azimuthal magnetic field is generated which is related to dynamo alpha -action. The corresponding alpha -parameter is negative (positive) in the northern (southern) disk hemisphere. This result is independent of q ranging between 0.6 and 1.5 and independent of the amount of diffusivity. The magnitude of alpha typically declines with decreasing q. We suggest a natural limit in the vicinity of q=0.6 below which alpha -action may be suppressed completely. Resistivity has a significant influence on the magnetic energy level of the final state. It is reduced for decreasing magnetic Reynolds number, Rem, as one might expect. However, the magneto-rotational instability is able to sustain an angular momentum transport of sufficient amount against diffusion even for the most diffusive case we considered, with Rem=200. The Shakura-Sunyaev parameter in this case is roughly 1/3 of that of the non-resistive model with the dominant contribution provided by the Reynolds stress rather than Maxwell stress. The dynamo alpha -effect is found to vanish for strong dissipation.},

abstract = { We present a five-wave Riemann solver for the equations of ideal relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. Our solver can be regarded as a relativistic extension of the five-wave HLLD Riemann solver initially developed by Miyoshi and Kusano for the equations of ideal MHD. The solution to the Riemann problem is approximated by a five wave pattern, comprised of two outermost fast shocks, two rotational discontinuities and a contact surface in the middle. The proposed scheme is considerably more elaborate than in the classical case since the normal velocity is no longer constant across the rotational modes. Still, proper closure to the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions can be attained by solving a nonlinear scalar equation in the total pressure variable which, for the chosen configuration, has to be constant over the whole Riemann fan. The accuracy of the new Riemann solver is validated against one dimensional tests and multidimensional applications. It is shown that our new solver considerably improves over the popular HLL solver or the recently proposed HLLC schemes. },

abstract = {A method of second-order accuracy is described for integrating the equations of ideal compressible flow. The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov's method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method.},

title = {Global Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Cylindrical Keplerian Disks},
abstract = {This paper presents a series of global three-dimensional accretion disk simulations carried out in the cylindrical limit in which the vertical component of the gravitational field is neglected. The simulations use a cylindrical pseudo-Newtonian potential, ~1/(R-Rg), to model the main dynamical properties of the Schwarzschild metric. The radial grid domain runs out to 60Rg to minimize the influence of the outer boundary on the inner disk evolution. The disks are initially constant density with a Keplerian angular momentum distribution and contain a weak toroidal or vertical field that serves as the seed for the magnetorotational instability. These simulations reaffirm many of the conclusions of previous local simulations. The magnetorotational instability (MRI) grows rapidly and produces MHD turbulence with a significant Maxwell stress that drives accretion. Tightly wrapped low-m spiral waves are prominent. In some simulations radial variations in Maxwell stress concentrate gas into rings, creating substantial spatial inhomogeneities. As in previous global simulations, there is a nonzero stress at the marginally stable orbit. The stress is smaller than seen in stratified torus simulations but nevertheless produces a small decline in specific angular momentum inside the last stable orbit. Detailed comparisons between simulations are used to examine the effects of various choices in computational setup. Because the driving instability is local, a reduction in the azimuthal computational domain to some fraction of 2π does not create large qualitative differences. Similarly, the choice of either an isothermal or adiabatic equation of state has little impact on the initial evolution. Simulations that begin with vertical fields have greater field amplification and higher ratios of stress to magnetic pressure compared with those beginning with toroidal fields. In contrast to MHD, hydrodynamics alone neither creates nor sustains turbulence.},

abstract = {We present X-ray/γ-ray spectra of Cyg X-1 observed during the transition from the hard to the soft state and in the soft state by ASCA, RXTE and CGRO/OSSE in 1996 May and June. The spectra consist of a dominant soft component below ~2keV and a power-law-like continuum extending to at least ~800keV. We interpret them as emission from an optically thick, cold accretion disc and from an optically thin, non-thermal corona above the disc. A fraction f>~0.5 of total available power is dissipated in the corona. We model the soft component by multicolour blackbody disc emission taking into account the torque-free inner-boundary condition. If the disc extends down to the minimum stable orbit, the ASCARXTE data yield the most probable black hole mass of MX~10Msolar and an accretion rate, <formula format="inline">Msolar~0.5LEc2, locating Cyg X-1 in the soft state in the upper part of the stable, gas-pressure-dominated, accretion-disc solution branch. The spectrum of the corona is well modelled by repeated Compton scattering of seed photons from the disc off electrons with a hybrid, thermal/non-thermal distribution. The electron distribution can be characterized by a Maxwellian with an equilibrium temperature of kTe~30-50keV, a Thomson optical depth of τ~0.3 and a quasi-power-law tail. The compactness of the corona is 2<~lh<~7, and a presence of a significant population of electron-positron pairs is ruled out. We find strong signatures of Compton reflection from a cold and ionized medium, presumably an accretion disc, with an apparent reflector solid angle, Ω/2π~0.5-0.7. The reflected continuum is accompanied by a broad iron Kα line.},

abstract = {Aims.We present the results of global 3-D MHD simulations of stratified and turbulent protoplanetary disc models. The aim of this work is to develop thin disc models capable of sustaining turbulence for long run times, which can be used for on-going studies of planet formation in turbulent discs. Methods: .The results are obtained using two codes written in spherical coordinates: GLOBAL and NIRVANA. Both are time-explicit and use finite differences along with the Constrained Transport algorithm to evolve the equations of MHD. Results: .In the presence of a weak toroidal magnetic field, a thin protoplanetary disc in hydrostatic equilibrium is destabilised by the magnetorotational instability (MRI). When the resolution is large enough (˜ 25 vertical grid cells per scale height), the entire disc settles into a turbulent quasi steady-state after about 300 orbits. Angular momentum is transported outward such that the standard α parameter is roughly 4-6 × 10-3. We find that the initial toroidal flux is expelled from the disc midplane and that the disc behaves essentially as a quasi-zero net flux disc for the remainder of the simulation. As in previous studies, the disc develops a dual structure composed of an MRI-driven turbulent core around its midplane, and a magnetised corona stable to the MRI near its surface. By varying disc parameters and boundary conditions, we show that these basic properties of the models are robust. Conclusions: .The high resolution disc models we present in this paper achieve a quasi-steady state and sustain turbulence for hundreds of orbits. As such, they are ideally suited to the study of outstanding problems in planet formation such as disc-planet interactions and dust dynamics.},

title = {The ∇.B=0 Constraint in Shock-Capturing Magnetohydrodynamics Codes},
abstract = {Seven schemes to maintain the ∇.B=0 constraint numerically are compared. All these algorithms can be combined with shock-capturing Godunov type base schemes. They fall into three categories: the eight-wave formulation maintains the constraint to truncation error, the projection scheme enforces the constraint in some discretization by projecting the magnetic field, while the five different versions of the constrained transport/central difference type schemes conserve ∇.B to machine accuracy in some discretization for every grid cell. It is shown that the three constrained transport algorithms, which have been introduced recently, can be recast into pure finite volume schemes, and the staggered representation of the magnetic field is unnecessary. Another two new and simple central difference based algorithms are introduced. The properties of the projection scheme are discussed in some detail, and I prove that it has the same order of accuracy as the base scheme even for discontinuous solutions. I describe a flexible and efficient implementation of the projection scheme using conjugate gradient type iterative methods. Generalizations to resistive MHD, to axial symmetry, and to non-Cartesian grids are given for all schemes. The theoretical discussion is followed by numerical tests, where the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the seven schemes and the base scheme can be directly compared. All simulations are done with the Versatile Advection Code, in which several shock-capturing base schemes are implemented. Although the eight-wave formulation usually works correctly, one of the numerical tests demonstrates that its non-conservative nature can occasionally produce incorrect jumps across strong discontinuities. Based on a large number of tests, the projection scheme, one of the new central difference based schemes, and one of the constrained transport schemes are found to be the most accurate and reliable among the examined methods.},

title = {The excitation of inertial-acoustic waves through turbulent fluctuations  in accretion discs I: WKBJ theory},
abstract = { We study and elucidate the mechanism of inertial-acoustic wave excitation in a turbulent, differentially rotating flow. We formulate a set of wave equations with sources that are only non-zero in the presence of turbulent fluctuations. We solve these using a WKBJ method. It is found that, for a particular azimuthal wave length, the wave excitation occurs through a sequence of regularly spaced swings during which the wave changes from leading to trailing form. This is a generic process that is expected to occur in shearing discs with turbulence. Pairs of trailing waves of equal amplitude propagating in opposite directions are produced and give rise to an outward angular momentum flux that we give expressions for as functions of the disc parameters and azimuthal wave length.  By solving the wave amplitude equations numerically we justify the WKBJ approach for a Keplerian rotation law for all parameter regimes of interest. In order to quantify the wave excitation approach completely the important wave source terms need to be specified. Assuming conditions of weak non-linearity, these can be identified and are associated with a quantity related to the potential vorticity, being the only survivors in the linear regime. Under the additional assumption that the source has a flat power spectrum at long azimuthal wave lengths, the optimal azimuthal wave length produced is found to be determined solely by the WKBJ response and is estimated to be 2pi H, with H being the putative disc scale height. In a following paper by Heinemann {\&} Papaloizou, we perform direct three dimensional simulations and compare results manifesting the wave excitation process and its source with the assumptions made and the theory developed here in detail, finding excellent agreement. },

title = {A Module for Radiation Hydrodynamic Calculations with ZEUS-2D Using Flux-limited Diffusion},
abstract = {A module for the ZEUS-2D code is described that may be used to solve the equations of radiation hydrodynamics to order unity in v/c, in the flux-limited diffusion (FLD) approximation. In this approximation, the factor Eddington tensor f, which closes the radiation moment equations, is chosen to be an empirical function of the radiation energy density. This is easier to implement and faster than full-transport techniques, in which f is computed by solving the transfer equation. However, FLD is less accurate when the flux has a component perpendicular to the gradient in radiation energy density and in optically thin regions when the radiation field depends strongly on angle. The material component of the fluid is here assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The energy equations are operator split, with transport terms, radiation diffusion term, and other source terms evolved separately. Transport terms are applied using the same consistent transport algorithm as in ZEUS-2D. The radiation diffusion term is updated using an alternating direction-implicit method with convergence checking. Remaining source terms are advanced together implicitly using numerical root finding. However, when absorption opacity is zero, accuracy is improved by instead treating the compression and expansion source terms using a time-centered differencing scheme. Results are discussed for test problems including radiation-damped linear waves, radiation fronts propagating in optically thin media, subcritical and supercritical radiating shocks, and an optically thick shock in which radiation dominates downstream pressure.},

title = {Direct calculation of the radiative efficiency of an accretion disk  around a black hole},
abstract = { Numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence makes it possible to study accretion dynamics in detail. However, special effort is required to connect inflow dynamics (dependent largely on angular momentum transport) to radiation (dependent largely on thermodynamics and photon diffusion). To this end we extend the flux-conservative, general relativistic MHD code HARM from axisymmetry to full 3D. The use of an energy conserving algorithm allows the energy dissipated in the course of relativistic accretion to be captured as heat. The inclusion of a simple optically thin cooling function permits explicit control of the simulated disk's geometric thickness as well as a direct calculation of both the amplitude and location of the radiative cooling associated with the accretion stresses. Fully relativistic ray-tracing is used to compute the luminosity received by distant observers. For a disk with aspect ratio H/r ~ 0.1 accreting onto a black hole with spin parameter a/M = 0.9, we find that there is significant dissipation beyond that predicted by the classical Novikov-Thorne model. However, much of it occurs deep in the potential, where photon capture and gravitational redshifting can strongly limit the net photon energy escaping to infinity. In addition, with these parameters and this radiation model, significant thermal and magnetic energy remains with the gas and is accreted by the black hole. In our model, the net luminosi ty reaching infinity is 6% greater than the Novikov-Thorne prediction. If the accreted thermal energy were wholly radiated, the total luminosity of the accretion flow would be ~20% greater than the Novikov-Thorne value. },

title = {Roe Matrices for Ideal MHD and Systematic Construction of Roe Matrices for Systems of Conservation Laws},
abstract = {In this paper, the construction of a Roe's scheme for the conservative system of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is presented. As this method relies on the computation of a Roe matrix, the problem is to find a matrix A(U_l, U_r) which satisfies the following properties. It is required to be consistent with the jacobian of the flux F, to have real eigenvalues, a complete set of eigenvectors and to satisfy the relation: DeltaF = A(U_l, U_r) DeltaU, where U_l and U_r are two admissible states and DeltaU their difference. For the ideal MHD system, using eulerian coordinates, a Roe matrix is obtained without any hypothesis on the specific heat ratio. Especially, its construction relies on an original expression of the magnetic pressure jump. Moreover, a Roe matrix is computed for lagrangian ideal MHD, by extending the results of Munz who obtained such a matrix for the system of lagrangian gas dynamics. So this second matrix involves arithmetic averages unlike the eulerian one, which contains classical Roe averages like in eulerian gas dynamics. In this paper, a systematic construction of lagrangian Roe matrices in terms of eulerian Roe matrices for a general system of conservation laws is also presented. This result, applied to the above eulerian and lagrangian matrices for ideal MHD, gives two new matrices for this system. In the same way, by applying this construction to the gas dynamics equations new Roe matrices are also obtained. All these matrices allow the construction of Roe type schemes. Some numerical examples on the shock tube problem show the applicability of this method.},

The code provides a multiphysics, multialgorithm modular environment particularly oriented toward the treatment of astrophysical flows in presence of discontinuities. Different hydrodynamic modules and algorithms may be independently selected to properly describe Newtonian, relativistic, MHD, or relativistic MHD fluids. The modular structure exploits a general framework for integrating a system of conservation laws, built on modern Godunov-type shock-capturing schemes. Although a plethora of numerical methods has been successfully developed over the past two decades, the vast majority shares a common discretization recipe, involving three general steps: a piecewise polynomial reconstruction followed by the solution of Riemann problems at zone interfaces and a final evolution stage. We have checked and validated the code against several benchmarks available in literature. Test problems in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions are discussed.},

abstract = { We measure the turbulent resistivity in the nonlinear regime of the MRI, and evaluate the turbulent magnetic Prandtl number. We perform a set of numerical simulations with the Eulerian finite volume codes Athena and Ramses in the framework of the shearing box model. We consider models including explicit dissipation coefficients and magnetic field topologies such that the net magnetic flux threading the box in both the vertical and azimuthal directions vanishes. We first demonstrate good agreement between the two codes by comparing the properties of the turbulent states in simulations having identical microscopic diffusion coefficients (viscosity and resistivity). We find the properties of the turbulence do not change when the box size is increased in the radial direction, provided it is elongated in the azimuthal direction. To measure the turbulent resistivity in the disk, we impose a fixed electromotive force on the flow and measure the amplitude of the saturated magnetic field that results. We obtain a turbulent resistivity that is in rough agreement with mean field theories like the Second Order Smoothing Approximation. The numerical value translates into a turbulent magnetic Prandtl number Pm_t of order unity. Pm_t appears to be an increasing function of the forcing we impose. It also becomes smaller as the box size is increased in the radial direction, in good agreement with previous results obtained in very large boxes. Our results are in general agreement with other recently published papers studying the same problem but using different methodology. Thus, our conclusion that Pm_t is of order unity appears robust. },

title = {Beyond ideal MHD: towards a more realistic modeling of relativistic  astrophysical plasmas},
abstract = { Many astrophysical processes involving magnetic fields and quasi-stationary processes are well described when assuming the fluid as a perfect conductor. For these systems, the ideal-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) description captures the dynamics effectively and a number of well-tested techniques exist for its numerical solution. Yet, there are several astrophysical processes involving magnetic fields which are highly dynamical and for which resistive effects can play an important role. The numerical modeling of such non-ideal MHD flows is significantly more challenging as the resistivity is expected to change of several orders of magnitude across the flow and the equations are then either of hyperbolic-parabolic nature or hyperbolic with stiff terms. We here present a novel approach for the solution of these relativistic resistive MHD equations exploiting the properties of implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge Kutta methods. By examining a number of tests we illustrate the accuracy of our approach under a variety of conditions and highlight its robustness when compared with alternative methods, such as the Strang-splitting. Most importantly, we show that our approach allows one to treat, within a unified framework, both those regions of the flow which are fluid-pressure dominated (such as in the interior of compact objects) and those which are instead magnetic-pressure dominated (such as in their magnetospheres) },

title = {Characterising the Gravitational Instability in Cooling Accretion Discs},
abstract = { We perform numerical analyses of the structure induced by gravitational instabilities in cooling gaseous accretion discs. For low enough cooling rates a quasi-steady configuration is reached, with the instability saturating at a finite amplitude in a marginally stable disc. We find that the saturation amplitude scales with the inverse square root of the cooling parameter beta = t_cool / t_dyn, which indicates that the heating rate induced by the instability is proportional to the energy density of the induced density waves. We find that at saturation the energy dissipated per dynamical time by weak shocks due is of the order of 20 per cent of the wave energy. From Fourier analysis of the disc structure we find that while the azimuthal wavenumber is roughly constant with radius, the mean radial wavenumber increases with radius, with the dominant mode corresponding to the locally most unstable wavelength. We demonstrate that the density waves excited in relatively low mass discs are always close to co-rotation, deviating from it by approximately 10 per cent. This can be understood in terms of the flow Doppler-shifted phase Mach number - the pattern speed self-adjusts so that the flow into spiral arms is always sonic. This has profound effects on the degree to which transport through self-gravity can be modelled as a viscous process. Our results thus provide (a) a detailed description of how the self-regulation mechanism is established for low cooling rates, (b) a clarification of the conditions required for describing the transport induced by self-gravity through an effective viscosity, (c) an estimate of the maximum amplitude of the density perturbation before fragmentation occurs, and (d) a simple recipe to estimate the density perturbation in different thermal regimes. },

title = {Turbulent Torques on Protoplanets in a Dead Zone},
abstract = {Migration of protoplanets in their gaseous host disks may be largely responsible for the observed orbital distribution of extrasolar planets. Recent simulations have shown that the magnetorotational turbulence thought to drive accretion in protoplanetary disks can affect migration by turning it into an orbital random walk. However, these simulations neglected the disk's ionization structure. Low ionization fraction near the midplane of the disk can decouple the magnetic field from the gas, forming a dead zone with reduced or no turbulence. Here, to understand the effect of dead zones on protoplanetary migration, we perform numerical simulations of a small region of a stratified disk with magnetorotational turbulence confined to thin active layers above and below the midplane. Turbulence in the active layers exerts decreased, but still measurable, gravitational torques on a protoplanet located at the disk midplane. We find a decrease of 2 orders of magnitude in the diffusion coefficient for dead zones with dead-to-active surface density ratios approaching realistic values in protoplanetary disks. This torque arises primarily from density fluctuations within a distance of one scale height of the protoplanet. Turbulent torques have correlation times of only ~0.3 orbital periods and apparently time-stationary distributions. These properties are encouraging signs that stochastic methods can be used to determine the orbital evolution of populations of protoplanets under turbulent migration. Our results indicate that dead zones may be dynamically distinct regions for protoplanetary migration.},

abstract = {We investigate fluid motions near the midplane of vertically stratified accretion disks with highly resistive midplanes. In such disks, the magnetorotational instability drives turbulence in thin layers surrounding a resistive, stable dead zone. The turbulent layers in turn drive motions in the dead zone. We examine the properties of these motions using three-dimensional, stratified, local, shearing-box, non-ideal, magnetohydrodynamical simulations. Although the turbulence in the active zones provides a source of vorticity to the midplane, no evidence for coherent vortices is found in our simulations. It appears that this is because of strong vertical oscillations in the dead zone. By analyzing time series of azimuthally averaged flow quantities, we identify an axisymmetric wave mode particular to models with dead zones. This mode is reduced in amplitude, but not suppressed entirely, by changing the equation of state from isothermal to ideal. These waves are too low frequency to affect sedimentation of dust to the midplane, but may have significance for the gravitational stability of the resulting midplane dust layers.},

abstract = {The processes of planet formation and migration depend intimately on the interaction between planetesimals and the gaseous disks in which they form. The formation of gaps in the disk can severely limit the mass of the planet and its migration toward the protostar. We investigate the process of gap formation through magnetohydrodynamic simulations in which internal stress arises self-consistently from turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability. The simulations investigate three different planetary masses and two disk temperatures to bracket the tidal (thermal) and viscous gap opening conditions. The results are in general qualitative agreement with previous simulations of gap formation but show significant differences. In the presence of MHD turbulence, the gaps produced are shallower and asymmetrically wider than those produced with pure hydrodynamics. The rate of gap formation is also slowed, with accretion occurring across the developing gap. Viscous hydrodynamics does not adequately describe the evolution, however, because planets capable of producing gaps also may be capable of affecting the level of MHD turbulence in different regions of the disk.},

title = {On the dynamics of magnetorotational turbulent stresses},
abstract = {The turbulent stresses that lead to angular momentum transport in accretion discs have often been treated as resulting from an isotropic effective viscosity, related to the pressure through the alpha parametrization of Shakura and Sunyaev. This simple approach may be adequate for the simplest aspects of accretion disc theory, and was necessitated historically by an incomplete understanding of the origin of the turbulence. More recently, Balbus and Hawley have shown that the magnetorotational instability provides a robust mechanism of generating turbulent Reynolds and Maxwell stresses in sufficiently ionized discs. The alpha viscosity model fails to describe numerous aspects of this process. The present paper introduces a new analytical model that aims to represent more faithfully the dynamics of magnetorotational turbulent stresses and bridge the gap between analytical studies and numerical simulations. Covariant evolutionary equations for the mean Reynolds and Maxwell tensors are presented, which correctly include the linear interaction with the mean flow. Non-linear and dissipative effects, in the absence of an imposed magnetic flux and in the limit of large Reynolds number and magnetic Reynolds number, are modelled through five non-linear terms that represent known physical processes and are strongly constrained by symmetry properties and dimensional considerations. The resulting model explains the development of statistically steady, anisotropic turbulent stresses in the shearing sheet, a local representation of a differentially rotating disc, in agreement with numerical simulations. It also predicts that purely hydrodynamic turbulence is not sustained in a flow that adequately satisfies Rayleigh's stability criterion. The model is usually formally hyperbolic and therefore `causal', and guarantees the realizability of the stress tensors. It should be particularly useful in understanding the dynamics of warped, eccentric and tidally distorted discs, non-Keplerian accretion flows close to black holes, and a variety of time-dependent accretion phenomena.},

title = {Microphysical dissipation, turbulence and magnetic fields in hyper-accreting discs},
abstract = {Hyper-accreting discs occur in compact-object mergers and in collapsed cores of massive stars. They power the central engine of γ-ray bursts in most scenarios. We calculate the microphysical dissipation (the viscosity and resistivity) of plasma in these discs, and discuss the implications for their global structure and evolution. At the temperatures (kBT > mec2) and densities (ρ ~ 109-1012gcm-3) characteristic of the neutrino-cooled innermost regions, the viscosity is provided mainly by mildly degenerate electrons, while the resistivity is modified from the Spitzer value due to the effects of both relativity and degeneracy. Under these conditions the magnetic Reynolds number is very large (ReM ~ 1019) and the plasma behaves as an almost ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fluid. Among the possible non-ideal MHD effects the Hall term is relatively the most important, while the magnetic Prandtl number, Pm (the ratio of viscosity to resistivity), is typically larger than unity: 10 <~ Pm <~ 6 × 103. Inspection of the outer radiatively inefficient regions indicates similar properties, with magnetic Prandtl numbers as high as ~104. Numerical simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) indicate that the saturation level and angular momentum transport efficiency may be greatly enhanced at high Prandtl numbers. If this behaviour persists in the presence of a strong Hall effect we would expect that hyper-accreting discs should be strongly magnetized and highly variable. The expulsion of magnetic field that cannot be dissipated at small scales may also favour a magnetic outflow. We note that there are limited similarities between hyper-accreting discs and X-ray binary discs - which also have a high magnetic Prandtl number close to the black hole - which suggests that a comparison between late-time activity in γ-ray bursts and X-ray binary accretion states may be fruitful. More generally, our results imply that the possibly different character of high Prandtl number MHD flows needs to be considered in studies and numerical simulations of hyper-accreting discs.},

abstract = {The radiation hydrodynamical (RHD) algorithms in ZEUS-2D are described. These algorithms use a tensor variable Eddington factor, computed from a solution of the static transfer equation, to close the system of radiation moment equations. This full transport algorithm, which differs significantly from more commonly used methods based on the diffusion approximation, is applicable in both optically thin and thick media. Results computed by these algorithms on a new collection of RHD test problems are presented. For the transfer equation, very detailed tests are possible which compare the numerical solution for the specific intensity at every point on a given tangent plane to the known analytic solution. It is shown that, while the interpolation inherent in the method of short characteristics makes the solution diffusive, it is not overly so. For certain restricted geometries and physical conditions, these methods reproduce the expected results either identically or qualitatively.},

title = {Numerical study of large-scale vorticity generation in shear-flow  turbulence},
abstract = { Simulations of stochastically forced shear-flow turbulence in a shearing-periodic domain are used to study the spontaneous generation of large-scale flow patterns in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the shear. Based on an analysis of the resulting large-scale velocity correlations it is argued that the mechanism behind this phenomenon could be the mean-vorticity dynamo effect pioneered by Elperin, Kleeorin, and Rogachevskii in 2003 (Phys. Rev. E 68, 016311). This effect is based on the anisotropy of the eddy viscosity tensor. One of its components may be able to replenish cross-stream mean flows by acting upon the streamwise component of the mean flow. Shear, in turn, closes the loop by acting upon the cross-stream mean flow to produce stronger streamwise mean flows. The diagonal component of the eddy viscosity is found to be of the order of the rms turbulent velocity divided by the wavenumber of the energy-carrying eddies. },

title = {Inside-Out Evacuation of Transitional Protoplanetary Disks by the  Magneto-Rotational Instability},
abstract = { How do T Tauri disks accrete? The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) supplies one means, but protoplanetary disk gas is typically too poorly ionized to be magnetically active. Here we show that the MRI can, in fact, explain observed accretion rates for the sub-class of T Tauri disks known as transitional systems. Transitional disks are swept clean of dust inside rim radii of ~10 AU. Stellar coronal X-rays ionize material in the disk rim, activating the MRI there. Gas flows from the rim to the star, at a rate limited by the depth to which X-rays ionize the rim wall. The wider the rim, the larger the surface area that the rim wall exposes to X-rays, and the greater the accretion rate. Interior to the rim, the MRI continues to transport gas; the MRI is sustained even at the disk midplane by super-keV X-rays that Compton scatter down from the disk surface. Accretion is therefore steady inside the rim. Blown out by radiation pressure, dust largely fails to accrete with gas. Contrary to what is usually assumed, ambipolar diffusion, not Ohmic dissipation, limits how much gas is MRI-active. We infer values for the transport parameter alpha on the order of 0.01 for GM Aur, TW Hyd, and DM Tau. Because the MRI can only afflict a finite radial column of gas at the rim, disk properties inside the rim are insensitive to those outside. Thus our picture provides one robust setting for planet-disk interaction: a protoplanet interior to the rim will interact with gas whose density, temperature, and transport properties are definite and decoupled from uncertain initial conditions. Our study also supplies half the answer to how disks dissipate: the inner disk drains from the inside out by the MRI, while the outer disk photoevaporates by stellar ultraviolet radiation. },

Our simulations reveal the co-existence of two quasi-steady states, a `quiet' state and an `active' turbulent state, confirming the predictions of the reduced model. The initial conditions determine on which state the simulation ultimately settles. The active state is strongly influenced by the geometry of the computational box and the thermal properties of the gas. Cubic domains support permanent channel flows, bar-shaped domains exhibit eruptive behaviour, and horizontal slabs give rise to infrequent channels.

abstract = {A new multi-state Harten Lax van Leer (HLL) approximate Riemann solver for the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations is developed based on the assumption that the normal velocity is constant over the Riemann fan. This assumption is same as that used in the HLLC (``C'' denotes Contact) approximate Riemann solver for the Euler equations. From the assumption, it is naturally derived that the Riemann fan should consist of four intermediate states for Bx ≠ 0, whereas the number of the intermediate states is reduced to two when Bx = 0. Since the intermediate states satisfied with all jump conditions in this approximate Riemann system are analytically obtained, the multi-state HLL Riemann solver can be constructed straightforwardly. It is shown that this solver can exactly resolve isolated discontinuities formed in the MHD system, and hence named as HLLD Riemann solver. (Here, ``D'' stands for Discontinuities.) It is also analytically proved that the HLLD Riemann solver is positively conservative like the HLLC Riemann solver. Indeed, the HLLD Riemann solver corresponds to the HLLC Riemann solver when the magnetic field vanishes. Numerical tests demonstrate that the HLLD Riemann solver is more robust and efficient than the linearized Riemann solver, and its resolution is equally good. It indicates that the HLLD solver must be useful in practical applications for the ideal MHD equations.},

abstract = { The source of viscosity in astrophysical accretion flows is still a hotly debated issue. We investigate the contribution of convective turbulence to the total viscosity in a self-consistent approach, where the strength of convection is determined from the vertical disc structure itself. Additional sources of viscosity are parametrized by a beta-viscosity prescription, which also allows an investigation of self-gravitating effects. In the context of accretion discs around stellar mass and intermediate mass black holes, we conclude that convection alone cannot account for the total viscosity in the disc, but significantly adds to it. For accretion rates up to 10% of the Eddington rate, we find that differential rotation provides a sufficiently large underlying viscosity. For higher accretion rates, further support is needed in the inner disc region, which can be provided by an MRI-induced viscosity. We briefly discuss the interplay of MRI, convection and differential rotation. We conduct a detailed parameter study of the effects of central masses and accretion rates on the disc models and find that the threshold value of the supporting viscosity is determined mostly by the Eddington ratio with only little influence from the central black hole mass. },

title = {Angular Momentum Transport by Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence in Accretion Disks: Gas Pressure Dependence of the Saturation Level of the Magnetorotational Instability},
abstract = {The saturation level of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is investigated using three-dimensional MHD simulations. The shearing box approximation is adopted and the vertical component of gravity is ignored, so that the evolution of the MRI is followed in a small local part of the disk. We focus on the dependence of the saturation level of the stress on the gas pressure, which is a key assumption in the standard α disk model. From our numerical experiments we find that there is a weak power-law relation between the saturation level of the Maxwell stress and the gas pressure in the nonlinear regime; the higher the gas pressure, the larger the stress. Although the power-law index depends slightly on the initial field geometry, the relationship between stress and gas pressure is independent of the initial field strength and is unaffected by ohmic dissipation if the magnetic Reynolds number is at least 10. The relationship is the same in adiabatic calculations, where pressure increases over time, and nearly isothermal calculations, where pressure varies little with time. Over the entire region of parameter space explored, turbulence driven by the MRI has many characteristic ratios such as that of the Maxwell stress to the magnetic pressure. We also find that the amplitudes of the spatial fluctuations in density and the time variability in the stress are characterized by the ratio of magnetic pressure to gas pressure in the nonlinear regime. Our numerical results are qualitatively consistent with an idea that the saturation level of the MRI is determined by a balance between the growth of the MRI and the dissipation of the field through reconnection. The quantitative interpretation of the pressure-stress relation, however, may require advances in the theoretical understanding of nonsteady magnetic reconnection.},

Waves that are expected to reach nonlinear amplitude at peak amplification become unstable to Kelvin-Helmholtz modes when |Wmax|>~Ω (where Wmax is the local maximum of vorticity and Ω the angular velocity). We study the evolution of a power-law distribution of vorticity consistent with Kolmogorov turbulence; in two dimensions long-lived vortices emerge and decay slowly, similar to previous studies. In three dimensions, however, vortices are unstable to bending modes, leading to rapid decay. Only vortices with a length-to-width ratio smaller than 1 survive; in three dimensions the residual kinetic energy and shear stress is at least 1 order of magnitude smaller than in two dimensions. No evidence for sustained hydrodynamic turbulence and transport is observed in three dimensions. Instead, at late times the residual transport is determined by the amplitude of slowly decaying, large-scale vortices (with horizontal extent comparable to the scale height of the disk), with additional contributions from nearly incompressible inertial waves possible. Evaluating the role that large-scale vortices play in astrophysical accretion disks will require understanding the mechanisms that generate and destroy them.},

title = {Axisymmetric Magnetorotational Instability in Viscous Accretion Disks},
abstract = {Axisymmetric magnetorotational instability (MRI) in viscous accretion disks is investigated by linear analysis and two-dimensional nonlinear simulations. The linear growth of the viscous MRI is characterized by the Reynolds number defined as RMRI≡v2A/νΩ, where vA is the Alfv{\'e}n velocity, ν is the kinematic viscosity, and Ω is the angular velocity of the disk. Although the linear growth rate is suppressed considerably as the Reynolds number decreases, the nonlinear behavior is found to be almost independent of RMRI. At the nonlinear evolutionary stage, a two-channel flow continues growing and the Maxwell stress increases until the end of calculations even though the Reynolds number is much smaller than unity. A large portion of the injected energy to the system is converted to the magnetic energy. The gain rate of the thermal energy, on the other hand, is found to be much larger than the viscous heating rate. Nonlinear behavior of the MRI in the viscous regime and its difference from that in the highly resistive regime can be explained schematically by using the characteristics of the linear dispersion relation. Applying our results to the case with both the viscosity and resistivity, it is anticipated that the critical value of the Lundquist number SMRI≡v2A/ηΩ for active turbulence depends on the magnetic Prandtl number SMRI,c~Pm1/2 in the regime of Pm>>1 and remains constant when Pm<<1, where Pm≡SMRI/RMRI=ν/η and η is the magnetic diffusivity.},

abstract = {We aim to illustrate the role of hot protons in enhancing the magnetorotational instability (MRI) via the ``hybrid'' viscosity, which is due to the redirection of protons interacting with static magnetic field perturbations, and to establish that it is the only relevant mechanism in this situation. It has recently been shown by Balbus \cite{PBM1} and Islam {\&} Balbus \cite{PBM11} using a fluid approach that viscous momentum transport is key to the development of the MRI in accretion disks for a wide range of parameters. However, their results do not apply in hot, advection-dominated disks, which are collisionless. We develop a fluid picture using the hybrid viscosity mechanism, that applies in the collisionless limit. We demonstrate that viscous effects arising from this mechanism can significantly enhance the growth of the MRI as long as the plasma {\$}\beta \gapprox 80{\$}. Our results facilitate for the first time a direct comparison between the MHD and quasi-kinetic treatments of the magnetoviscous instability in hot, collisionless disks.},

title = {Stability and nonlinear adjustment of vortices in Keplerian flows},
abstract = {Aims.We investigate the stability, nonlinear development and equilibrium structure of vortices in a background shearing Keplerian flow Methods: We make use of high-resolution global two-dimensional compressible hydrodynamic simulations. We introduce the concept of nonlinear adjustment to describe the transition of unbalanced vortical fields to a long-lived configuration. Results: We discuss the conditions under which vortical perturbations evolve into long-lived persistent structures and we describe the properties of these equilibrium vortices. The properties of equilibrium vortices appear to be independent from the initial conditions and depend only on the local disk parameters. In particular we find that the ratio of the vortex size to the local disk scale height increases with the decrease of the sound speed, reaching values well above the unity. The process of spiral density wave generation by the vortex, discussed in our previous work, appear to maintain its efficiency also at nonlinear amplitudes and we observe the formation of spiral shocks attached to the vortex. The shocks may have important consequences on the long term vortex evolution and possibly on the global disk dynamics. Conclusions: Our study strengthens the arguments in favor of anticyclonic vortices as the candidates for the promotion of planetary formation. Hydrodynamic shocks that are an intrinsic property of persistent vortices in compressible Keplerian flows are an important contributor to the overall balance. These shocks support vortices against viscous dissipation by generating local potential vorticity and should be responsible for the eventual fate of the persistent anticyclonic vortices. Numerical codes have be able to resolve shock waves to describe the vortex dynamics correctly.},

title = {Episodic accretion in magnetically layered protoplanetary discs},
abstract = {We study protoplanetary disc evolution assuming that angular momentum transport is driven by gravitational instability at large radii, and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the hot inner regions. At radii of the order of 1au such discs develop a magnetically layered structure, with accretion occurring in an ionized surface layer overlying quiescent gas that is too cool to sustain MHD turbulence. We show that layered discs are subject to a limit cycle instability, in which accretion on to the protostar occurs in ~104-yr bursts with M{\.o}~10-5Msolaryr-1, separated by quiescent intervals lasting ~105yr where M{\.o}~10-8Msolaryr-1. Such bursts could lead to repeated episodes of strong mass outflow in young stellar objects. The transition to this episodic mode of accretion occurs at an early epoch (t<<1Myr), and the model therefore predicts that many young pre-main-sequence stars should have low rates of accretion through the inner disc. At ages of a few Myr, the discs are up to an order of magnitude more massive than the minimum-mass solar nebula, with most of the mass locked up in the quiescent layer of the disc at r~1au. The predicted rate of low-mass planetary migration is reduced at the outer edge of the layered disc, which could lead to an enhanced probability of giant planet formation at radii of 1-3au.},

title = {Toward a Unified View of Black-Hole High-Energy States},
abstract = {We present here a review of high energy (>1 keV) observations of seven black hole candidates, six of which have estimates masses. In this review we focus on two parameters of interest: the ratio of "non-thermal" to total luminosity as a function of the total luminosity divided by the Eddington luminosity, and the root mean square (rms) variability as a function of the non-thermal to total luminosity ratio. Below ~10% Eddington luminosity, the sources tend to be strictly non-thermal (the so called "off" and "low" states). Above this luminosity the sources become mostly thermal (the "high" state), with the non-thermal component increasing with luminosity (the "very high" and "flare" states). There are important exceptions to this behavior, however, and no steady--as opposed to transient--source has been observed over a wide range of parameter space. In addition, the rms variability is positively correlated with the ratio of non-thermal to total luminosity, although there may be a minimum level of varibility associated with "thermal" states. We discuss these results in light of theoretical models and find that currently no single model describes the full range of black hole high energy behavior. In fact, the observations are exactly opposite from what one expects based upon simple notions of accretion disk instabilities. (SECTION: Stars)},

The early history of V1057 is examined along with its spectral classification, radial velocities, line structure, colors, dimensions, IR excesses, and associated reflection nebulae. The discovery of V1515 Cyg is discussed, spectral characteristics and statistics of the three known FU Ori variables are evaluated, and it is suggested that the mean time between successive outbursts of the FU Ori type in an individual T Tauri star is roughly 10,000 years. Some effects of one or more FU Ori-type eruptions in the young sun on matter in the inner solar nebula are considered together with several proposed explanations for the cause of such outbursts.

Magnetic fields have at once powerful and subtle influences on the behavior of (sufficiently) ionized gas, rendering them directly unstable to free energy gradients. Outwardly descreasing angular velocity profiles are unstable.

abstract = {The magnetorotational instability is thought to be responsible for the generation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence that leads to enhanced outward angular momentum transport in accretion discs. Here, we present the first formal analytical proof showing that, during the exponential growth of the instability, the mean (averaged over the disc scaleheight) Reynolds stress is always positive, the mean Maxwell stress is always negative, and hence the mean total stress is positive and leads to a net outward flux of angular momentum. More importantly, we show that the ratio of the Maxwell to the Reynolds stresses during the late times of the exponential growth of the instability is determined only by the local shear and does not depend on the initial spectrum of perturbations or the strength of the seed magnetic field. Even though we derived this property of the stress tensors for the exponential growth of the instability in incompressible flows, numerical simulations of shearing boxes show that this characteristic is qualitatively preserved under more general conditions, even during the saturated turbulent state generated by the instability.},

title = {Unstable Planetary Systems Emerging Out Of Gas Disks},
abstract = { The discovery of over 300 extrasolar planets allows us to test our understanding of formation and dynamics of planetary systems statistically via numerical simulations. Traditional N-body simulations without a gas disk have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the observed systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively compact when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable within the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small semimajor axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed beyond the ice line, as the standard planet formation theory suggests.  In this paper, we perform numerical simulations of multi-planet systems in dissipating gas disks to (1) verify the initial conditions of the N-body simulations, and (2) constrain the initial conditions which reproduce both the observed a and e distributions simultaneously. We find that the planetary systems tend to be dynamically "inactive" when the gas disks dissipate, and therefore the initial conditions of the N-body simulations may not be recovered. We also find that the eccentricity damping in the gas disk may need to be inefficient, possibly due to the saturation of corotation torques, to reproduce both a and e distributions satisfactorily. },

The dispersion relation includes compressibility and radiative effects in the flux-limited diffusion approximation. By introducing an effective speed of sound, all the effects of radiation transport can be subsumed into one single parameter. It can be shown that the growth rates of the vertical modes - which are the fastest growing ones - are reduced by radiative transport. For the case of non-vertical modes, the growth rates may instead be enhanced. We quantify the effects of compressibility and radiative diffusion on the growth rates for the gas-pressure dominated case. The analytical discussion is supplemented by numerical simulations, which are also used for a first investigation of the non-linear stage of the MRI in gas-pressure dominated accretion discs with radiation transport included. },

title = {Diffusion coefficient of a passive contaminant in a local MHD model of a turbulent accretion disc},
abstract = {We calculate the radial diffusion coefficient for a passive contaminant in an accretion disc which is turbulent due to the action of the magnetorotational instability. Numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are used to follow the evolution of a local patch of the disc using the shearing box formalism. A separate continuity equation for the mass fraction of contaminant is integrated along with the MHD system, and radial profiles of this fraction are obtained as a function of time. Solutions of a linear diffusion equation are fitted to the numerical measured profiles of the contaminant, treating the diffusion coefficient D as the fitting parameter. At early times, the value of D is found to vary; however, once the contaminant is spread over scales comparable to the box size, it saturates at a steady value. The ratio of D to the transport coefficient of angular momentum due to shear stress is small. If D can be used as a proxy for the turbulent magnetic diffusivity, the effective magnetic Prandtl number Peff=ν/D (where ν is the coefficient of `effective viscosity' associated with shear stress) would be large.},

title = {Transport of Large Scale Poloidal Flux in Black Hole Accretion},
abstract = { We perform a global, three-dimensional GRMHD simulation of an accretion torus embedded in a large scale vertical magnetic field orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole. This simulation investigates how a large scale vertical field evolves within a turbulent accretion disk and whether global magnetic field configurations suitable for launching jets and winds can develop. We identify a ``coronal mechanism'' of magnetic flux motion, which dominates the global flux evolution. In this coronal mechanism, magnetic stresses driven by orbital shear create large-scale half-loops of magnetic field that stretch radially inward and then reconnect, leading to discontinuous jumps in the location of magnetic flux. This mechanism is supplemented by a smaller amount of flux advection in the accretion flow proper. Because the black hole in this case does not rotate, the magnetic flux on the horizon determines the mean magnetic field strength in the funnel around the disk axis; this field strength is regulated by a combination of the magnetic and gas pressures in the inner disk. We compare these results to several previously-suggested descriptions of magnetic flux motion in disks, in particular the idea that flux advection is determined by the ratio of an effective viscosity to an effective resistivity. Flux motion is non-local, and cannot be described by a simple diffusive process. Further, flux transport depends on the magnetic field itself in a nonlinear fashion and cannot be described in terms of a turbulent viscosity and turbulent resistivity that are independent of the field. },

title = {Coronae as Consequence of Large Scale Magnetic Fields in Turbulent  Accretion Disks},
abstract = { Non-thermal X-ray emission in compact accretion engines can be interpreted to result from magnetic dissipation in an optically thin magnetized corona above an optically thick accretion disk. If coronal magnetic field originates in the disk and the disk is turbulent, then only magnetic structures large enough for their turbulent shredding time to exceed their buoyant rise time survive the journey to the corona. We use this concept and a physical model to constrain the minimum fraction of magnetic energy above the critical scale for buoyancy as a function of the observed coronal to bolometric emission. Our results suggest that a significant fraction of the magnetic energy in accretion disks resides in large scale fields, which in turn provides circumstantial evidence for significant non-local transport phenomena and the need for large scale magnetic field generation. For the example of Seyfert AGN, for which of order 30 per cent of the bolometric flux is in the X-ray band, we find that more than 20 per cent of the magnetic energy must be of large enough scale to rise and dissipate in the corona. },

title = {Large-scale dynamos at low magnetic Prandtl numbers},
abstract = { Using direct simulations of hydromagnetic turbulence driven by random polarized waves it is shown that dynamo action is possible over a wide range of magnetic Prandtl numbers from 10^-3 to 1. Triply periodic boundary conditions are being used. In the final saturated state the resulting magnetic field has a large-scale component of Beltrami type. For the kinematic phase, growth rates have been determined for magnetic Prandtl numbers between 0.01 and 1, but only the case with the smallest magnetic Prandtl number shows large-scale magnetic fields. It is less organized than in the nonlinear stage. For small magnetic Prandtl numbers the growth rates are comparable to those calculated from an alpha squared mean-field dynamo. In the linear regime the magnetic helicity spectrum has a short inertial range compatible with a -5/3 power law, while in the nonlinear regime it is the current helicity whose spectrum may be compatible with such a law. In the saturated case, the spectral magnetic energy in the inertial range is in slight excess over the spectral kinetic energy, although for small magnetic Prandtl numbers the magnetic energy spectrum reaches its resistive cut off wavenumber more quickly. The viscous energy dissipation declines with the square root of the magnetic Prandtl number, which implies that most of the energy is dissipated via Joule heat. },

title = {Orbital Advection by Interpolation: A Fast and Accurate Numerical Scheme for Super-Fast MHD Flows},
abstract = {In numerical models of thin astrophysical disks that use a Eulerian scheme, gas orbits supersonically through a fixed grid. As a result the time step is sharply limited by the Courant condition. Also, because the mean flow speed with respect to the grid varies with position, the truncation error varies systematically with position. For hydrodynamic (unmagnetized) disks an algorithm called FARGO has been developed that advects the gas along its mean orbit using a separate interpolation substep. This relaxes the constraint imposed by the Courant condition, which now depends only on the peculiar velocity of the gas, and results in a truncation error that is more nearly independent of position. This paper describes a FARGO-like algorithm suitable for evolving magnetized disks. Our method is second-order-accurate on a smooth flow and preserves ∇˙B=0 to machine precision. The main restriction is that B must be discretized on a staggered mesh. We give a detailed description of an implementation of the code and demonstrate that it produces the expected results on linear and nonlinear problems. We also point out how the scheme might be generalized to make the integration of other supersonic/superfast flows more efficient. Although our scheme reduces the variation of truncation error with position, it does not eliminate it. We show that the residual position dependence leads to characteristic radial variations in the density over long integrations.},

title = {Formation of Magnetically Supported Disks during Hard-to-Soft Transitions in Black Hole Accretion Flows},
abstract = {We carried out three-dimensional global resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the cooling instability in optically thin hot black hole accretion flows by assuming bremsstrahlung cooling. General relativistic effects are simulated using the pseudo-Newtonian potential. The cooling instability grows when the density of the accretion disk becomes sufficiently large. We found that as the instability grows the accretion flow changes from an optically thin, hot, gas pressure-supported state (low/hard state) to a cooler, magnetically supported, quasi-steady state. During this transition, the magnetic pressure exceeds the gas pressure because the disk shrinks in the vertical direction while almost conserving the toroidal magnetic flux. Since further vertical contraction of the disk is suppressed by magnetic pressure, the cool disk stays in an optically thin, spectrally hard state. The magnetically supported disk exists for a time scale much longer than the thermal time scale, and comparable to the accretion time scale. We examined the stability of the magnetically supported disk analytically, assuming that the toroidal magnetic flux is conserved, and found it to be thermally and secularly stable. Our findings may explain why black hole candidates stay in luminous, hard state even when their luminosity exceeds the threshold for the onset of the cooling instability.},

title = {Nonlinear Stability, Hydrodynamical Turbulence, and Transport in Disks},
abstract = {By a combined analytical and numerical approach, we investigate the three-dimensional hydrodynamical nonlinear stability of both differential rotation and pure shear flows. Since the high Reynolds number instabilities in question are in essence inviscid, a Navier-Stokes code is generally not necessary for their elucidation. Although our numerical code has little difficulty finding nonlinear instability in shear layers and in rotationally supported disks with constant specific angular momentum (the latter appears to be a new result), there is no evidence of any kind that Keplerian disks are nonlinearly unstable. This stability is hardly unique to a Keplerian rotation law, but is a property of any velocity profile with angular velocity decreasing outward and angular momentum increasing outward. A simple analytic analysis (from first principles) suggests that the key to nonlinear stability in rotationally supported disks is the interaction of correlated velocity fluctuations (which determine the nature of turbulent transport) with the background mean flow. In Rayleigh-unstable disks, outward transport extracts both energy and angular momentum from the mean flow gradients and imparts them to the velocity fluctuations; in a Keplerian disk outward transport interacts with the mean angular momentum gradient to act as a sink for azimuthal velocity fluctuations. The first case is linearly unstable; the second is both linearly and nonlinearly stable. In a shear layer, the velocity gradient is a source of free energy, and there are no fluctuation interactions with the mean flow to create a dynamical sink. These flows are nonlinearly unstable, since turbulence, once created, is sustainable. Our formalism is also extremely useful in understanding why nonlinear numerical simulations have been yielding inward transport in convectively unstable disks. When there is overlap, our findings are consistent with well-established results of other investigations, both numerical and laboratory. We discuss the effective Reynolds number of the numerical code. We note, however, that the classical Taylor investigation already suggests that to simulate even linear (Rayleigh) instability, and effective Reynolds number in excess of 103 is required. We believe that the results of this investigation all but rule out any kind of self-generated hydrodynamical turbulence as a source of anomalous accretion disk transport. In an unmagnetized disk, global nonaxisymmetric instabilities and spiral waves remain, in principle, viable mechanisms.},

abstract = {We apply a new, second-order Godunov code, Athena, to studies of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) using unstratified shearing box simulations with a uniform net vertical field and a sinusoidally varying zero net vertical field. The Athena results agree well with similar studies that used different numerical algorithms, including the observation that the turbulent energy decreases with increasing resolution in the zero net field model. We conduct analyses to study the flow of energy from differential rotation to turbulent fluctuations to thermalization. A study of the time correlation between the rates of change of different volume-averaged energy components shows that energy injected into turbulent fluctuations dissipates on a timescale of Ω--1, where Ω is the orbital frequency of the local domain. Magnetic dissipation dominates over kinetic dissipation, although not by as great a factor as the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy. We Fourier-transform the magnetic and kinetic energy evolution equations and, using the assumption that the time-averaged energies are constant, determine the level of numerical dissipation as a function of length scale and resolution. By modeling numerical dissipation as if it were physical in origin, we characterize numerical resistivity and viscosity in terms of effective Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. The resulting effective magnetic Prandtl number is ~2, independent of resolution or initial field geometry. MRI simulations with effective Reynolds and Prandtl numbers determined by numerical dissipation are not equivalent to those where these numbers are set by physical resistivity and viscosity. These results serve, then, as a baseline for future shearing box studies where dissipation is controlled by the inclusion of explicit viscosity and resistivity.},

title = {Oscillations of the Inner Regions of Viscous Accretion Disks},
abstract = { Although quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been discovered in different X-ray sources, their origin is still a matter of debate. Analytical studies of hydrodynamic accretion disks have shown three types of trapped global modes with properties that appear to agree with the observations. However, these studies take only linear effects into account and do not address the issues of mode excitation and decay. Moreover, observations suggest that resonances between modes play a crucial role. A systematic, numerical study of this problem is therefore needed. In this paper, we use a pseudo-spectral algorithm to perform a parameter study of the inner regions of hydrodynamic disks. By assuming alpha-viscosity, we show that steady state solutions rarely exist. The inner edges of the disks oscillate and excite axisymmetric waves. In addition, the flows inside the inner edges are sometimes unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations. One-armed, or even two-armed, spirals are developed, which provides a plausible explanation for the high-frequency QPOs observed from accreting black holes. When the Reynolds numbers are above certain critical values, the inner disks go through some transient turbulent states characterized by strong trailing spirals; while large-scale leading spirals developed in the outer disks. We compared our numerical results with standard thin disk oscillation models. Although the non-axisymmetric features have their analytical counterparts, more careful study is needed to explain the axisymmetric oscillations. },

The authors describe a new numerical technique, called constrained transport (CT), for evolving the induction equation in a way that maintains vanishing divergence of the poloidal (constrained) field components to within machine round-off error. It is also shown how the 3+1 formalism of numerical relativity can be used to express the general relativistic MHD equations in a form suitable for numerical evolution. The relativistic form of the magnetic induction equation is then shown to fit naturally within the CT scheme. Several models involving magnetized flow near a black hole are used as calibration of the CT scheme.},

title = {Nonlinear Evolution of the Magnetorotational Instability in Ion-Neutral Disks},
abstract = {We carry out three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the magnetorotational (Balbus-Hawley) instability in weakly ionized plasmas. We adopt a formulation in which the ions and neutrals are treated as separate fluids coupled only through a collisional drag term. Ionization and recombination processes are not considered. The linear stability of the ion-neutral system has been previously considered by Blaes {\&} Balbus. Here we extend their results to the nonlinear regime by computing the evolution of the Keplerian angular momentum distribution in the local shearing box approximation. We find significant turbulence and angular momentum transport when the collisional frequency is on the order of 100 times the orbital frequency Omega . At higher collision rates, the two-fluid system studied here behaves much like the fully ionized systems studied previously. At lower collision rates, the evolution of the instability is determined primarily by the properties of the ions, with the neutrals acting as a sink for the turbulence. Since in this regime saturation occurs when the magnetic field is superthermal with respect to the ion pressure, we find that the amplitude of the magnetic energy and the corresponding angular momentum transport rate is proportional to the ion density. Our calculations show that the ions and neutrals are essentially decoupled when the collision frequency is less than 0.01 Omega ; in this case, the ion fluid behaves as in the single-fluid simulations and the neutrals remain quiescent. We find that purely toroidal initial magnetic field configurations are unstable to the magnetorotational instability across the range of coupling frequencies.},

title = {Enhanced MHD transport in astrophysical accretion flows: turbulence,  winds and jets},
abstract = { Astrophysical accretion is arguably the most prevalent physical process in the Universe; it occurs during the birth and death of individual stars and plays a pivotal role in the evolution of entire galaxies. Accretion onto a black hole, in particular, is also the most efficient mechanism known in nature, converting up to 40% of accreting rest mass energy into spectacular forms such as high-energy (X-ray and gamma-ray) emission and relativistic jets. Whilst magnetic fields are thought to be ultimately responsible for these phenomena, our understanding of the microphysics of MHD turbulence in accretion flows as well as large-scale MHD outflows remains far from complete. We present a new theoretical model for astrophysical disk accretion which considers enhanced vertical transport of momentum and energy by MHD winds and jets, as well as transport resulting from MHD turbulence. We also describe new global, 3D simulations that we are currently developing to investigate the extent to which non-ideal MHD effects may explain how small-scale, turbulent fields (generated by the magnetorotational instability - MRI) might evolve into large-scale, ordered fields that produce a magnetized corona and/or jets where the highest energy phenomena necessarily originate. },

title = {Nonlinear Evolution of Gravitational Fragmentation Regulated by Magnetic  Fields and Ambipolar Diffusion},
abstract = { We present results from an extensive set of simulations of gravitational fragmentation in the presence of magnetic fields and ambipolar diffusion. The average fragmentation spacing in the nonlinear phase of evolution is in excellent agreement with the prediction of linear perturbation theory. The time scale for nonlinear growth and runaway of the first core is {\$}\approx 10{\$} times the calculated growth time {\$}\taugm{\$} of the eigenmode with minimum growth time, when starting from a uniform background state with small-amplitude white-noise perturbations. Subcritical and transcritical models typically evolve on a significantly longer time scale than the supercritical models. Infall motions in the nonlinear fully-developed contracting cores are subsonic on the core scale in subcritical and transcritical clouds, but are somewhat supersonic in supercritical clouds. Core mass distributions are sharply peaked with a steep decline to large masses, consistent with the existence of a preferred mass scale for each unique set of dimensionless free parameters. However, a sum total of results for various initial mass-to-flux ratios yields a broad distribution reminiscent of observed core mass distributions. Based on our results, we conclude that fragmentation spacings, magnitude of infall motions, core shapes, and, especially, the curvature of magnetic field morphology, may serve as indirect observational means of determining a cloud's ambient mass-to-flux ratio. },

title = {Modelling the behaviour of accretion flows in X-ray binaries. Everything you always wanted to know about accretion but were afraid to ask},
abstract = {We review how the recent increase in X-ray and radio data from black hole and neutron star binaries can be merged together with theoretical advances to give a coherent picture of the physics of the accretion flow in strong gravity. Both long term X-ray light curves, X-ray spectra, the rapid X-ray variability and the radio jet behaviour are consistent with a model where a standard outer accretion disc is truncated at low luminosities, being replaced by a hot, inner flow which also acts as the launching site of the jet. Decreasing the disc truncation radius leads to softer spectra, as well as higher frequencies (including quasi periodic oscillations, QPOs) in the power spectra, and a faster jet. The collapse of the hot flow when the disc reaches the last stable orbit triggers the dramatic decrease in radio flux, as well as giving a qualitative (and often quantitative) explanation for the major hard soft spectral transition seen in black holes. The neutron stars are also consistent with the same models, but with an additional component due to their surface, giving implicit evidence for the event horizon in black holes. We review claims of observational data which conflict with this picture, but show that these can also be consistent with the truncated disc model. We also review suggested alternative models for the accretion flow which do not involve a truncated disc. The most successful of these converge on a similar geometry, where there is a transition at some radius larger than the last stable orbit between a standard disc and an inner, jet dominated region, with the X-ray source associated with a mildly relativistic outflow, beamed away from the disc. However, the observed uniformity of properties between black holes at different inclinations suggests that even weak beaming of the X-ray emission may be constrained by the data. After collapse of the hot inner flow, the spectrum in black hole systems can be dominated by the disc emission. Its behaviour is consistent with the existence of a last stable orbit, and such data can be used to estimate the black hole spin. By contrast, these systems can also show very different spectra at these high luminosities, in which the disc spectrum (and probably structure) is strongly distorted by Comptonization. The structure of the accretion flow becomes increasingly uncertain as the luminosity approaches (and exceeds) the Eddington luminosity, though there is growing evidence that winds may play an important role. We stress that these high Eddington fraction flows are key to understanding many disparate and currently very active fields such as ULX, Narrow Line Seyfert 1's, and the growth of the first black holes in the Early Universe.},

title = {Radiation processes around accreting black holes},
abstract = { Accreting sources such as AGN, X-ray binaries or gamma-ray bursts are known to be strong, high energy emitters. The hard emission is though to originate from plasmas of thermal and/or non-thermal high energy particles. Not only does this emission allow to probe the unique properties of the matter in an extreme environment, but it also has a crucial backreaction on the energetics and the dynamics of the emitting medium itself. Understanding interactions between radiation and matter has become a key issue in the modelling of high energy sources. Although most cross sections are well known, they are quite complex and the way all processes couple non-linearly is still an open issue.  We present a new code that solves the local, kinetic evolution equations for distributions of electrons, positrons and photons, interacting by radiation processes such as self-absorbed synchrotron and brems-strahlung radiation, Compton scattering, pair production/annihilation, and by Coulomb collisions. The code is very general and aimed to modelled various high energy sources. As an application, we study the spectral states of X-ray binaries, including thermalization by Coulomb collisions and synchrotron self-absorption. It is found that the low-hard and high-soft states can be modelled with different illumination but the same non-thermal acceleration mechanism. },

abstract = { We analyze the time dependence of fluid variables in general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion flows onto a black hole with dimensionless spin parameter a/M=0.9. We consider both the case where the angular momentum of the accretion material is aligned with the black hole spin axis (an untilted flow) and where it is misaligned by 15 degrees (a tilted flow). In comparison to the untilted simulation, the tilted simulation exhibits a clear excess of inertial variability, that is, variability at frequencies below the local radial epicyclic frequency. We further study the radial structure of this inertial-like power by focusing on a radially extended band at 118 (M/10Msol)^-1 Hz found in each of the three analyzed fluid variables. The three dimensional density structure at this frequency suggests that the power is a composite oscillation whose dominant components are an over dense clump corotating with the background flow, a low order inertial wave, and a low order inertial-acoustic wave. Our results provide preliminary confirmation of earlier suggestions that disk tilt can be an important excitation mechanism for inertial waves. },

The simulated tilted disks showed dramatic differences from comparable untilted disks, such as asymmetrical accretion onto the hole through opposing "plunging streams" and global precession of the disk powered by a torque provided by the black hole. However, those simulations used a traditional spherical-polar grid that was purposefully underresolved along the pole, which prevented us from assessing the behavior of any jets that may have been associated with the tilted disks. To address this shortcoming we have added a block-structured "cubed-sphere" grid option to the Cosmos++ GRMHD code, which will allow us to simultaneously resolve the disk and polar regions. Here we present our implementation of this grid and the results of a small suite of validation tests intended to demonstrate that the new grid performs as expected. The most important test in this work is a comparison of identical tilted disks, one evolved using our spherical-polar grid and the other with the cubed-sphere grid. We also demonstrate an interesting dependence of the early-time evolution of our disks on their orientation with respect to the grid alignment. This dependence arises from the differing treatment of current sheets within the disks, especially whether they are aligned with symmetry planes of the grid or not.},

title = {On the viability of the shearing box approximation for numerical studies of MHD turbulence in accretion disks},
abstract = {Context: Most of our knowledge of the nonlinear development of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) relies on the results of numerical simulations employing the shearing box (SB) approximation. A number of difficulties arising from this approach have recently been pointed out in the literature. Aims: We thoroughly examine the effects of the assumptions made and numerical techniques employed in SB simulations. This is done to clarify and gain a better understanding of those difficulties, in addition to a number of additional serious problems raised here for the first time, and of their impact on the results. Methods: We used analytical derivations and estimates as well as comparative analysis to methods used in the numerical study of turbulence. We performed numerical experiments to support some of our claims and conjectures. Results: The following problems, arising from the (virtually exclusive) use of SB simulations as a tool for the understanding and quantification of the nonlinear MRI development in disks, are analyzed and discussed: (i) inconsistencies in the application of the SB approximation itself; (ii) the limited spatial scale of the SB; (iii) the lack of convergence of most ideal mgnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations; (iv) side-effects of the SB symmetry and the non-trivial nature of the linear MRI; and (v) physical artifacts arising from the very small box scale due to periodic boundary conditions. Conclusions: The computational and theoretical challenge posed by the MHD turbulence problem in accretion disks cannot be met by the SB approximation, as it has been used to date. A new strategy to confront this challenge is proposed, based on techniques widely used in numerical studies of turbulent flows - developing (e.g., with the help of local numerical studies) a sub-grid turbulence model and implementing it in global calculations.},

abstract = { The high energy emission of microquasars is thought to originate from high energy particles. Depending on the spectral state, the distribution of these particles can be thermal with a high temperature (typically 100 keV) or non-thermal and extending to even higher energy. The properties of high energy plasmas are governed by a rich microphysics involving particle-particle collisions and particles-photons interactions.  We present a new code developed to address the evolution of relativistic plasmas. This one-zone code focuses on the microphysics and solves the coupled kinetic equations for particles and photons, including Compton scattering, synchrotron emission and absorption, pair production and annihilation, bremsstrahlung emission and absorption, Coulomb interactions, and prescriptions for additional particle acceleration and heating. It can in particular describe mechanisms such a thermalisation by synchrotron self-absorption and Coulomb collisions.  Using the code, we investigate whether various acceleration processes, namely thermal heating, non-thermal acceleration and stochastic acceleration, can reproduce the different spectral states of microquasars. Premilinary results are presented. },

The appropriate linearized MHD equations are solved by employing the WKB approximation and the results are verified numerically. The eigenfrequencies as well as eigenfunctions are explicitly obtained. It is demonstrated that the initial perturbation remains confined within the disk. It is further shown that thin enough disks are stable but as their thickness grows increasing number of unstable modes participate in the solution of the initial value problem. However it is demonstrated that due to the localization of the initial perturbation the growth time of the instability is significantly longer than the calculated inverse growth rate of the individual unstable eigenfunctions. },

title = {On the Vertical Structure of Radiation-dominated Accretion Disks},
abstract = {The vertical structure of black hole accretion disks in which radiation dominates the total pressure is investigated using a three-dimensional radiation-MHD calculation. The domain is a small patch of disk centered 100 Schwarzschild radii from a black hole of 108 Msolar, and the stratified shearing-box approximation is used. Magnetorotational instability converts gravitational energy to turbulent magnetic and kinetic energy. The gas is heated by magnetic dissipation and by radiation damping of the turbulence, and cooled by diffusion and advection of radiation through the vertical boundaries. The resulting structure differs in several fundamental ways from the standard Shakura-Sunyaev picture. The disk consists of three layers. At the midplane, the density is large, and the magnetic pressure and total accretion stress are less than the gas pressure. In lower density surface layers that are optically thick, the magnetic pressure and stress are greater than the gas pressure but less than the radiation pressure. Horizontal density variations in the surface layers exceed an order of magnitude. Magnetic fields in the regions of greatest stress are buoyant, and dissipate as they rise, so the heating rate declines more slowly with height than the stress. Much of the dissipation occurs at low column depth, and the interior is cooler and less radiation-dominated than in the Shakura-Sunyaev model with the same surface mass density and flux. The mean structure is convectively stable.},

abstract = { We investigate the stability of incompressible, exact, non-ideal magnetorotational (MRI) modes against parasitic instabilities for a broad range of dissipation coefficients, relevant to astrophysical and laboratory environments. This allows us to uncover the asymptotic behavior of the fastest parasites in terms of the Elsasser number, {\$}\Lambda_\eta{\$}, when viscous effects are not important. We calculate the fastest growing parasitic modes feeding off the MRI and show that they correspond to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities for {\$}\Lambda_\eta \ge 1{\$} and tearing mode instabilities for {\$}\Lambda_\eta < 1{\$}. We study in detail the regime {\$}\Lambda_\eta \simeq 1{\$} where both types of modes present comparable growth rates. We conjecture about the asymptotic behavior of saturation based on the idea that the saturation level of the MRI can be estimated by comparing growth rates (or amplitudes) of primary and secondary modes. In the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, {\$}\Lambda_\eta \gg 1{\$}, where Kelvin-Helmholtz modes dominate, these estimates lead to saturation levels for the stresses that are in rough agreement with current numerical simulations. For resistive MHD, {\$}\Lambda_\eta \lesssim 1{\$}, the stresses produced by the MRI primary modes, at the time when the fastest tearing modes have growth rates similar to their own, decay proportionally to the Elsasser number. This behavior seems consistent with numerical simulations of resistive MHD shearing boxes. },

abstract = { We present results from three-dimensional, self-gravitating radiation hydrodynamical models of gas accretion by planetary cores. In some cases, the accretion flow is resolved down to the surface of the solid core - the first time such simulations have been performed. We investigate the dependence of the gas accretion rate upon the planetary core mass, and the surface density and opacity of the encompassing protoplanetary disc. Accretion of planetesimals is neglected.  We find that high-mass protoplanets are surrounded by thick circumplanetary discs during their gas accretion phase but, contrary to locally-isothermal calculations, discs do not form around accreting protoplanets with masses ~< 50M_Earth when radiation hydrodynamical simulations are performed, even if the grain opacity is reduced from interstellar values by a factor of 100. We find that the opacity of the gas plays a large role in determining the accretion rates for low-mass planetary cores. For example, reducing the opacities from interstellar values by a factor of 100 leads to roughly an order of magnitude increase in the accretion rates for 10-20M_Earth protoplanets. The dependence on opacity becomes less important in determining the accretion rate for more massive cores where gravity dominates the effects of thermal support and the protoplanet is essentially accreting at the runaway rate. Finally, for low-mass planetary cores (~< 20M_Earth), we obtain accretion rates that are in agreement with previous one-dimensional quasi-static models. This indicates that three-dimensional hydrodynamical effects may not significantly alter the gas accretion timescales that have been obtained from quasi-static models. },

The proposed method of solution draws on the recent work of Miyoshi and Kusano, in the context of adiabatic MHD, where an approximate solution to the Riemann problem is sought in terms of an average constant velocity and total pressure across the Riemann fan. This allows the formation of four intermediate states enclosed by two outermost fast discontinuities and separated by two rotational waves and an entropy mode. In the present work, a corresponding derivation for the isothermal MHD equations is presented. It is found that the absence of the entropy mode leads to a different formulation which is based on a three-state representation rather than four. Numerical tests in one and two dimensions demonstrate that the new solver is robust and comparable in accuracy to the more expensive linearized solver of Roe, although considerably faster.},

title = {High-Order Finite Difference GLM-MHD Schemes for Cell-Centered MHD},
abstract = { We present and compare third- as well as fifth-order accurate finite difference schemes for the numerical solution of the compressible ideal MHD equations in multiple spatial dimensions. The selected methods lean on four different reconstruction techniques based on recently improved versions of the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, monotonicity preserving (MP) schemes as well as slope-limited polynomial reconstruction. The proposed numerical methods are highly accurate in smooth regions of the flow, avoid loss of accuracy in proximity of smooth extrema and provide sharp non-oscillatory transitions at discontinuities.  We suggest a numerical formulation based on a cell-centered approach where all of the primary flow variables are discretized at the zone center. The divergence-free condition is enforced by augmenting the MHD equations with a generalized Lagrange multiplier yielding a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic correction, as in Dedner et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 175 (2002) 645-673). The resulting family of schemes is robust, cost-effective and straightforward to implement. Compared to previous existing approaches, it completely avoids the CPU intensive workload associated with an elliptic divergence cleaning step and the additional complexities required by staggered mesh algorithms.  Extensive numerical testing demonstrate the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework for computations involving both smooth and discontinuous features. },

abstract = {The central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is believed to be a hot and dense disk with hyperaccretion onto a few solar-mass black hole. We investigate where the magnetorotational instability (MRI) actively operates in the hyperaccretion disk, which can cause angular momentum transport in the disk. The inner region of hyperaccretion disks can be neutrino opaque, and the energy and momentum transport by neutrinos could affect the growth of the MRI significantly. Assuming reasonable disk models and a weak magnetic field B<~1014 G, it is found that the MRI is strongly suppressed by the neutrino viscosity in the inner region of hyperaccretion disks. On the other hand, the MRI can drive active magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the outer neutrino-transparent region regardless of the field strength. This suggests that the baryonic matter is accumulated into the inner dead zone, where the MRI grows inactively and the angular momentum transport is inefficient. When the dead zone gains a large amount of mass and becomes gravitationally unstable, intense mass accretion onto the central black hole would occur episodically through the gravitational torque. This process can be a physical mechanism of the short-term variability in the prompt emission of GRBs. Finally, the origin of flaring activities in the X-ray afterglow is predicted in the context of our episodic accretion scenario.},

title = {Local Magnetohydrodynamic Models of Layered Accretion Disks},
abstract = {Using numerical MHD simulations, we have studied the evolution of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in stratified accretion disks in which the ionization fraction (and therefore resistivity) varies substantially with height. This model is appropriate to dense, cold disks around protostars or dwarf nova systems, which are ionized by external irradiation of cosmic rays or high-energy photons. We find that the growth and saturation of the MRI occurs only in the upper layers of the disk where the magnetic Reynolds number exceeds a critical value; in the midplane the disk remains quiescent. The vertical Poynting flux into the ``dead'' central zone is small; however, velocity fluctuations in the dead zone driven by the turbulence in the active layers generate a significant Reynolds stress in the midplane. When normalized by the thermal pressure, the Reynolds stress in the midplane never drops below about 10\% of the value of the Maxwell stress in the active layers, even though the Maxwell stress in the dead zone may be orders of magnitude smaller than this. Significant mass mixing occurs between the dead zone and active layers. Fluctuations in the magnetic energy in the active layers can drive vertical oscillations of the disk in models in which the ratio of the column density in the dead zone to that in the active layers is less than 10. These results have important implications for the global evolution of a layered disk; in particular, there may be residual mass inflow in the dead layer. We discuss the effects that dust in the disk may have on our results.},

title = {The Effect of Resistivity on the Nonlinear Stage of the Magnetorotational Instability in Accretion Disks},
abstract = {We present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) with a nonzero ohmic resistivity. The simulations begin from a homogeneous (unstratified) density distribution and use the local shearing-box approximation. The evolution of a variety of initial field configurations and strengths is considered for several values of the constant coefficient of resistivity η. For uniform vertical and toroidal magnetic fields, we find unstable growth consistent with the linear analyses; finite resistivity reduces growth rates and, when large enough, stabilizes the MRI. Even when unstable modes remain, resistivity has significant effects on the nonlinear state. The properties of the saturated state depend on the initial magnetic field configuration. In simulations with an initial uniform vertical field, the MRI is able to support angular momentum transport even for large resistivities through the quasi-periodic generation of axisymmetric radial channel solutions rather than through the maintenance of anisotropic turbulence. Reconnective processes rather than parasitic instabilities mediate the resurgent channel solution in this case. Simulations with zero-net flux show that the angular momentum transport and the amplitude of magnetic energy after saturation are significantly reduced by finite resistivity, even at levels where the linear modes are only slightly affected. The MRI is unable to sustain angular momentum transport and turbulent flow against diffusion for ReM<~104, where the Reynolds number is defined in terms of the disk scale height and sound speed, ReM=csH/η. As this is close to the Reynolds numbers expected in low, cool states of dwarf novae, these results suggest that finite resistivity may account for the low and high angular momentum transport rates inferred for these systems.},

In steady state, the specific angular momentum profile of the inflowing magnetized gas deviates by less than 2% from that of the standard thin disk model of Novikov and Thorne.

title = {Fomalhaut's Debris Disk and Planet: Constraining the Mass of Fomalhaut b  From Disk Morphology},
abstract = { Following the optical imaging of the exoplanet candidate Fomalhaut b (Fom b), we present a numerical model of how Fomalhaut's debris disk is gravitationally shaped by a single interior planet. The model is simple, adaptable to other debris disks, and can be extended to accommodate multiple planets. We find that to not disrupt the belt, Fom b must have a mass < 3 Jupiter masses. Previous mass constraints based on disk morphology rely on several oversimplifications. We explain why our constraint is more reliable. It is based on a global model of the disk that is not restricted to the planet's chaotic zone boundary. Moreover, we screen disk parent bodies for dynamical stability over the system age of 100 Myr, and model them separately from their dust grain progeny; the latter's orbits are strongly affected by radiation pressure and their lifetimes are limited to 0.1 Myr by destructive grain-grain collisions. The single planet model predicts that planet and disk orbits be apsidally aligned. Preliminary analysis of Fom b's space velocity does not bear this out. The disagreement might be resolved by having additional perturbers in the Fomalhaut system, for which there is independent evidence from the star's anomalous Hipparcos acceleration. Our upper mass limit of 3 Jupiter masses for Fom b is not affected by these considerations. The belt contains at least 3 Earth masses of solids that are grinding down to dust. Such a large mass in solids is consistent with Fom b having formed in situ. },

title = {Disk masses in the embedded and T Tauri phases of stellar evolution},
abstract = { (Abridged). Motivated by a growing concern that masses of circumstellar disks may have been systematically underestimated by conventional observational methods, we present a numerical hydrodynamics study of time-averaged disk masses (<M_d>) around low-mass Class 0, Class I, and Class II objects. Mean disk masses ({\o}verline{M}_d) are then calculated by weighting the time-averaged disk masses according to the corresponding stellar masses using a power-law weight function with a slope typical for the Kroupa initial mass function of stars. Two distinct types of disks are considered: self-gravitating disks, in which mass and angular momentum are redistributed exclusively by gravitational torques, and viscous disks, in which both the gravitational and viscous torques are at work. We find that self-gravitating disks have mean masses that are slowly increasing along the sequence of stellar evolution phases. More specifically, Class 0/I/II self-gravitating disks have mean masses {\o}verline{M}_d=0.09, 0.10, and 0.12 M_sun, respectively. Viscous disks have similar mean masses ({\o}verline{M}_d=0.10-0.11 M_sun) in the Class 0/I phases but almost a factor of 2 lower mean mass in the Class II phase ({\o}verline{M}_d,CII=0.06 M_sun). In each evolution phase, time-averaged disk masses show a large scatter around the mean value. Our obtained mean disk masses are larger than those recently derived by Andrews {\&} Williams and Brown et al., regardless of the physical mechanisms of mass transport in the disk. },

abstract = { The saturation mechanism of Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI) is examined through analytical quasilinear theory and through nonlinear computation of a single mode in a rotating disk. We find that large-scale magnetic field is generated through the alpha effect (the correlated product of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations) and causes the MRI mode to saturate. If the large-scale plasma flow is allowed to evolve, the mode can also saturate through its flow relaxation. In astrophysical plasmas, for which the flow cannot relax because of gravitational constraints, the mode saturates through field generation only. },

title = {On the stability of an accretion disc containing a toroidal magnetic field},
abstract = {We study the stability of an accretion disc with an embedded toroidal magnetic field to general perturbations. Disc models are considered in which the equilibrium variables depend on both the radial and vertical coordinates. We consider the full global problem in which the disc may be in the form of a narrow annulus, or occupy a significant radial extent. Perturbations with azimuthal mode number m in the range zero up to the ratio of the radius to disc semithickness are considered. Discs containing a purely toroidal magnetic field are always found to be unstable. We find spectra of unstable modes using local techniques. In the absence of dissipation, these modes may occupy arbitrarily small scales in the radial and vertical directions. One class of modes is driven primarily by buoyancy, while the other is driven by shear independently of the equilibrium stratification. The first type of instability predominates if the field is large, while the second type predominates if the field is weak and the underlying medium is strongly stable to convection. We also investigate stability by solving the initial value problem for perturbations numerically. We find, for our disc models, that local instabilities predominate over any possible global instability. Their behaviour is in good accord with the local analysis. The associated growth rates become just less than the orbital frequency when the ratio of magnetic energy density to pressure reaches about 10 per cent. Instabilities of the kinds discussed here may provide a mechanism for limiting the growth of toroidal fields in dynamo models of accretion discs.},

title = {Modification of Angular Velocity by Inhomogeneous MRI Growth in  Protoplanetary Disks},
abstract = { We have investigated evolution of magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in protoplanetary disks that have radially non-uniform magnetic field such that stable and unstable regions coexist initially, and found that a zone in which the disk gas rotates with a super-Keplerian velocity emerges as a result of the non-uniformly growing MRI turbulence. We have carried out two-dimensional resistive MHD simulations with a shearing box model. We found that if the spatially averaged magnetic Reynolds number, which is determined by widths of the stable and unstable regions in the initial conditions and values of the resistivity, is smaller than unity, the original Keplerian shear flow is transformed to the quasi-steady flow such that more flattened (rigid-rotation in extreme cases) velocity profile emerges locally and the outer part of the profile tends to be super-Keplerian. Angular momentum and mass transfer due to temporally generated MRI turbulence in the initially unstable region is responsible for the transformation. In the local super-Keplerian region, migrations due to aerodynamic gas drag and tidal interaction with disk gas are reversed. The simulation setting corresponds to the regions near the outer and inner edges of a global MRI dead zone in a disk. Therefore, the outer edge of dead zone, as well as the inner edge, would be a favorable site to accumulate dust particles to form planetesimals and retain planetary embryos against type I migration. },

title = {Vertical Structure of Gas Pressure-dominated Accretion Disks with Local Dissipation of Turbulence and Radiative Transport},
abstract = {We calculate the vertical structure of a local patch of an accretion disk in which heating by dissipation of MRI-driven MHD turbulence is balanced by radiative cooling. Heating, radiative transport, and cooling are computed self-consistently with the structure by solving the equations of radiation MHD in the shearing-box approximation. Using a fully three-dimensional and energy-conserving code, we compute the structure of this disk segment over a span of more than five cooling times. After a brief relaxation period, a statistically steady state develops. Measuring height above the midplane in units of the scale height predicted by a Shakura-Sunyaev model, we find that magnetic pressure causes the disk atmosphere to stretch upward, with the photosphere rising to ~=7H, in contrast to the ~=3H predicted by conventional analytic models. This more extended structure, as well as fluctuations in the height of the photosphere, may lead to departures from Planckian form in the emergent spectra. Dissipation is distributed across the region within ~=3H of the midplane but is very weak at greater altitudes. As a result, the temperature deep in the disk interior is less than that expected when all heat is generated in the midplane. With only occasional exceptions, the gas temperature stays very close to the radiation temperature, even above the photosphere. Because fluctuations in the dissipation are particularly strong away from the midplane, the emergent radiation flux can track dissipation fluctuations with a lag that is only 0.1-0.2 times the mean cooling time of the disk. Long-timescale asymmetries in the dissipation distribution can also cause significant asymmetry in the flux emerging from the top and bottom surfaces of the disk. Radiative diffusion dominates Poynting flux in the vertical energy flow throughout the disk.},

title = {GRMHD prediction of coronal variability in accreting black holes},
abstract = { On the basis of data from an energy-conserving 3D general relativistic MHD simulation, we predict the statistical character of variability in the coronal luminosity from accreting black holes. When the inner boundary of the corona is defined to be the electron scattering photosphere, its location depends only on the mass accretion rate in Eddington units (\dot{M}). Nearly independent of viewing angle and \dot{M}, the power spectrum over the range of frequencies from approximately the orbital frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) to ~100 times lower is well approximated by a power-law with index -2, crudely consistent with the observed power spectra of hard X-ray fluctuations in AGN and the hard states of Galactic binary black holes. The underlying physical driver for variability in the light curve is variations in the accretion rate caused by the chaotic character of MHD turbulence, but the power spectrum of the coronal light output is significantly steeper. Part of this contrast is due to the fact that the mass accretion rate can be significantly modulated by radial epicyclic motions that do not result in dissipation, and therefore do not drive luminosity fluctuations. The other part of this contrast is due to the inward decrease of the characteristic inflow time, which leads to decreasing radial coherence length with increasing fluctuation frequency. },

We explore when protostellar disk accretion is likely to be highly variable. While constant {\$}\alpha{\$} disks can in principle adjust their accretion rates to match infall rates, protostellar disks are unlikely to have constant {\$}\alpha{\$}. In particular we show that neither models with angular momentum ransport due solely to the magnetorotational instability (MRI) nor ravitational instability (GI) are likely to transport disk mass at rotostellar infall rates over the large range of radii needed to move infalling envelope material down to the central protostar. We show that the MRI and GI are likely to combine to produce outbursts of rapid accretion starting at a few AU. Our analysis is consistent with the time-dependent models of Armitage, Livio, {\&} Pringle (2001) and agrees with our observational study of the outbursting object FU Ori. },

abstract = {The dynamical foundations of alpha disk models are described. At the heart of the viscous formalism of accretion disk models are correlations in the fluctuating components of the disk velocity, magnetic field, and gravitational potential. We relate these correlations to the large-scale mean flow dynamics used in phenomenological viscous disk models. MHD turbulence readily lends itself to the alpha formalism, but transport by self-gravity does not. Nonlocal transport is an intrinsic property of turbulent self-gravitating disks, which in general cannot be captured by an alpha model. Local energy dissipation and alpha-like behavior can be reestablished if the pattern speeds associated with the amplitudes of an azimuthal Fourier decomposition of the turbulence are everywhere close to the local rotation frequency. In this situation, global wave transport must be absent. Shearing box simulations, which employ boundary conditions forcing local behavior, are probably not an adequate tool for modeling the behavior of self-gravitating disks. As a matter of principle, it is possible that disks that hover near the edge of gravitational stability may behave in accord with a local alpha model, but global simulations performed to date suggest matters are not this simple.},

title = {A test suite for magnetohydrodynamical simulations},
abstract = {A collection is presented of MHD problems that will provide researchers who have interests in modeling MHD phenomena with a battery of tests (a 'test suite') for calibrating their numerical algorithms. Use of these tests will provide a common reference for comparison of different numerical MHD algorithms. The test suite includes both 1D and 2D problems. Taken together, these problems test the abilities of a numerical method to propagate accurately all of the MHD wave families in moving and stationary media, to capture MHD shocks and contact discontinuities, and to model accurately Lorentz force terms in multiple dimensions. An example solution of each test problem is presented. Diagnostic convergence-testing procedures that provide a quantitative evaluation of MHD algorithms are demonstrated.},

title = {Surface Structure in an Accretion Disk Annulus with Comparable Radiation and Gas Pressure},
abstract = {We have employed a three-dimensional energy-conserving radiation MHD code to simulate the vertical structure and thermodynamics of a shearing box whose parameters were chosen so that the radiation and gas pressures would be comparable. The upper layers of this disk segment are magnetically dominated, creating conditions appropriate for both photon bubble and Parker instabilities. We find little evidence for photon bubbles, even though the simulation has enough spatial resolution to see them and their predicted growth rates are high. On the other hand, there is strong evidence for Parker instabilities, and they appear to dominate the evolution of the magnetically supported surface layers. The disk photosphere is complex, with large density inhomogeneities at both the scattering and effective (thermalization) photospheres of the evolving horizontally averaged structure. Both the dominant magnetic support and the inhomogeneities are likely to have strong effects on the spectrum and polarization of thermal photons emerging from the disk atmosphere. The inhomogeneities are also large enough to affect models of reflection spectra from the atmospheres of accretion disks.},

abstract = { The magnetic Prandtl number Pr_M is the ratio of viscosity to resistivity. In astrophysical disks the diffusion of angular momentum (viscosity) and magnetic fields (resistivity) are controlled by turbulence. Phenomenological models of the evolution of large scale poloidal magnetic fields in disks suggest that the turbulent magnetic Prandtl number Pr_{M,T} controls the rate of escape of vertical field from the disk; for Pr_{M,T} leq R/H vertical field diffuses outward before it can be advected inward by accretion. Here we measure field diffusion and angular momentum transport due to MHD turbulence in a shearing box, and thus Pr_{M,T}, by studying the evolution of a sinusoidal perturbation in the magnetic field that is injected into a turbulent background. We show that the perturbation is always stable, decays approximately exponentially, has decay rate proportional to k^2, and that the implied Pr_{M,T} ~ 1. },

abstract = { We present an analysis of data stemming from numerical simulations of decaying magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence up to grid resolution of 1536^3 points and up to Taylor Reynolds number of 1200. The initial conditions are such that the initial velocity and magnetic fields are helical and in equipartition, while their correlation is negligible. Analyzing the data at the peak of dissipation, we show that the dissipation in MHD seems to asymptote to a constant as the Reynolds number increases, thereby strengthening the possibility of fast reconnection events in the solar environment for very large Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, intermittency of MHD flows, as determined by the spectrum of anomalous exponents of structure functions of the velocity and the magnetic field, is stronger than for fluids, confirming earlier results; however, we also find that there is a measurable difference between the exponents of the velocity and those of the magnetic field, as observed recently in the solar wind. Finally, we discuss the spectral scaling laws that arise in this flow. },

title = {The excitation of inertial-acoustic waves through turbulent fluctuations  in accretion discs II: Numerical Simulations with MRI driven turbulence},
abstract = { We present fully three-dimensional local simulations of compressible MRI turbulence with the object of studying and elucidating the excitation of the non-axisymmetric inertial acoustic waves that are observed to always be present. They are potentially important for affecting protoplanetary migration through the action of associated stochastic gravitational forces and producing residual transport in MHD inactive regions into which they may propagate. The simulations we perform are with zero net flux and produce mean activity levels corresponding to the Shakura {\&} Sunyaev alpha ~ 0.005, being at the lower end of the range usually considered in accretion disc modelling. We reveal the nature of the mechanism responsible for the excitation of these waves by determining the time dependent evolution of the Fourier transforms of the participating state variables. The dominant waves are found to have no vertical structure and to be excited during periodically repeating swings in which they change from leading to trailing. The initial phase of the evolution of such a swing is found to be in excellent agreement with that expected from the WKBJ theory developed in a preceding paper by Heinemann {\&} Papaloizou. However, shortly after the attainment of the expected maximum wave amplitude, the waves begin to be damped on account of the formation of weak shocks. As expected from the theory the waves are seen to shorten in radial wavelength as they propagate. As a consequence the waves are almost always seen to be in the non linear regime. The mean angular momentum transport associated with the waves generated in our simulations is estimated to be a small but significant fraction of roughly 0.1 of that associated with the mean Reynolds stress. },

abstract = { We study energy dissipation and heating by supersonic MHD turbulence in molecular clouds using Athena, a new higher-order Godunov code. We analyze the dependence of the saturation amplitude, energy dissipation characteristics, power spectra, sonic scaling, and indicators of intermittency in the turbulence on factors such as the magnetic field strength, driving scale, energy injection rate, and numerical resolution. While convergence in the energies is reached at moderate resolutions, we find that the power spectra require much higher resolutions that are difficult to obtain. In a 1024^3 hydro run, we find a power law relationship between the velocity dispersion and the spatial scale on which it is measured, while for an MHD run at the same resolution we find no such power law. The time-variability and temperature intermittency in the turbulence both show a dependence on the driving scale, indicating that numerically driving turbulence by an arbitrary mechanism may not allow a realistic representation of these properties. We also note similar features in the power spectrum of the compressive component of velocity for supersonic MHD turbulence as in the velocity spectrum of an initially-spherical MHD blast wave, implying that the power law form does not rule out shocks, rather than a turbulent cascade, playing a significant role in the regulation of energy transfer between spatial scales. },

abstract = { Using flow models based on axisymmetric general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations, we construct radiative models for sgr A*. Spectral energy distributions that include the effects of thermal synchrotron emission and absorption, and Compton scattering, are calculated using a Monte Carlo technique. Images are calculated using a ray-tracing scheme. All models are scaled so that the 230 GHz flux density is 3.4 Jy. The key model parameters are the dimensionless black hole spin a*, the inclination i, and the ion-to-electron temperature ratio Ti/Te. We find that: (1) models with Ti/Te=1 are inconsistent with the observed submillimeter spectral slope; (2) the X-ray flux is a strongly increasing function of a*; (3) the X-ray flux is a strongly increasing function of i; (4) 230 GHz image size is a complicated function of i, a*, and Ti/Te, but the Ti/Te = 10 models are generally large and at most marginally consistent with the 230 GHz VLBI data; (5) for models with Ti/Te=10 and i=85 deg the event horizon is cloaked behind a synchrotron photosphere at 230 GHz and will not be seen by VLBI, but these models overproduce NIR and X-ray flux; (6) in all models whose SEDs are consistent with observations the event horizon is uncloaked at 230 GHz; (7) the models that are most consistent with the observations have a* \sim 0.9. We finish with a discussion of the limitations of our model and prospects for future improvements. },

title = {The Saturation Limit of the Magnetorotational Instability},
abstract = { Simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in a homogeneous shearing box have shown that the asymptotic strength of the magnetic field declines steeply with increasing resolution. Here I model the MRI driven dynamo as a large scale dynamo driven by the vertical magnetic helicity flux. This growth is balanced by large scale mixing driven by a secondary instability. The saturated magnetic energy density depends almost linearly on the vertical height of the typical eddies. The MRI can drive eddies with arbitrarily large vertical wavenumber, so the eddy thickness is either set by diffusive effects, by the magnetic tension of a large scale vertical field component, or by magnetic buoyancy effects. In homogeneous, zero magnetic flux, simulations only the first effect applies and the saturated limit of the dynamo is determined by explicit or numerical diffusion. The exact result depends on the numerical details, but is consistent with previous work, including the claim that the saturated field energy scales as the gas pressure to the one quarter power (which we interpret as an artifact of numerical dissipation). The magnetic energy density in a homogeneous shearing box will tend to zero as the resolution of the simulation increases, but this has no consequences for the dynamo or for angular momentum transport in real accretion disks. The claim that the saturated state depends on the magnetic Prandtl number may also be an artifact of simulations in which microphysical transport coefficients set the MRI eddy thickness. Finally, the efficiency of the MRI dynamo is a function of the ratio of the Alfv{\'e}n velocity to the product of the pressure scale height and the local shear. As this approaches unity from below the dynamo reaches maximum efficiency. },

abstract = {We investigate the effect of shear viscosity, ν, and Ohmic resistivity, η, on the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in vertically stratified accretion disks through a series of local simulations with the Athena code. First, we use a series of unstratified simulations to calibrate physical dissipation as a function of resolution and background field strength; the effect of the magnetic Prandtl number, Pm = ν/η, on the turbulence is captured by ∼32 grid zones per disk scale height, H. In agreement with previous results, our stratified disk calculations are characterized by a subthermal, predominately toroidal magnetic field that produces MRI-driven turbulence for |z| ~ 2H. Above |z| ∼ 2H, the magnetic pressure dominates and the field is buoyantly unstable. Large-scale radial and toroidal fields are also generated near the mid-plane and subsequently rise through the disk. The polarity of this mean field switches on a roughly 10 orbit period in a process that is well modeled by an α--Ω dynamo. Turbulent stress increases with Pm but with a shallower dependence compared to unstratified simulations. For sufficiently large resistivity, η ∼ csH/1000, where cs is the sound speed, MRI turbulence within 2H of the mid-plane undergoes periods of resistive decay followed by regrowth. This regrowth is caused by amplification of the toroidal field via the dynamo. This process results in large amplitude variability in the stress on 10--100 orbital timescales, which may have relevance for partially ionized disks that are observed to have high- and low-accretion states.},

abstract = {First, distributions of surface densities of dust materials and gases in a preplanetary solar nebula, which give a good fit to the distribution of the planetary mass, are presented and the over-all structure of this nebula, which is in thermal and gravitational equilibrium, is studied. Second, in order to see magnetic effect on the structure, electric conductivity of a gas ionized by cosmic rays and radioactivities contained in dust grains is estimated for each region of the nebula and, then, the growth and decay of seed magnetic fields, which are due to differential rotation of the nebula and to the Joule dissipation, respectively, are calculated. The results indicate that, in regions of the terrestrial planets, magnetic fields decay much faster than they grow and magnetic effects can be ignored, except for the outermost layers of very low density. This is not the case for regions of Uranus and Neptune where magnetic fields can be amplified to considerable extents. Third, the transport of angular momentum due to magnetic and mechanical turbulent viscosities and the resultant redistribution of surface density in the nebula are investigated. The results show that the density redistribution occurs, in general, in a direction to attain a distribution of surface density which has nearly the same r-dependence as that obtained from the present distribution of the planetary mass. This redistribution seems to be possible if it occurs at a formation stage of the nebula where the presence of large viscosities is expected. Finally, a comment is given on the initial condition of a collapsing interstellar cloud from which the solar nebula is formed at the end of the collapse.},
